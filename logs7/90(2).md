- **Final**: (3-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:** 1. **Analysis of Previous Daytime Interactions:**    - Player 8, who was killed, expressed suspicion towards Player 7 before their elimination.    - Multiple players, including Player 6 and Player 4, have also expressed concerns about Player 7's behavior.    - Player 3 claims to be the guard and also indicated suspicion towards Player 7.  2. **Night Phase:**    - No one was killed during the night, which could imply effective protection from the guard or an undecided decision by the wolves.  3. **Current Daytime Observations:**    - Consensus seems to be forming against Player 7 based on their quick accusations and attempts to divert suspicion.    - Player 3's guarded approach and role claim add weight to their observations.  4. **Strategic Decision:**    - Given the gathered evidence and consensus, it is rational to vote for Player 7, who appears to be the most suspicious.    - It is crucial to align with the majority to avoid unnecessary divisions and potential negative outcomes for the villager faction.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote for Player 7.
