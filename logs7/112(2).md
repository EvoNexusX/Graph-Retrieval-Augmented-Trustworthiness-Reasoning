- **Final**: (1-th night) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Review Night Phase Information:**    - We have been informed that Players 5, 6, and 8 are all werewolves.    - My goal is to align with my werewolf teammates and vote to kill a non-werewolf player.  2. **Evaluate the Voting Pattern:**    - Player 5 has already chosen to kill Player 1. This indicates that Player 1 is considered a threat or is suspected to be a non-werewolf by Player 5.  3. **Assess Threat Levels:**    - Player 1 has been identified as a significant threat to us (level 0.9).    - Players 2, 3, 4, and 7 are also threats, but Player 1 is specifically targeted by a fellow werewolf, which increases the likelihood of Player 1 being a non-werewolf or posing a significant threat.  4. **Align with Team Strategy:**    - To ensure our strategy is coordinated, I should vote to kill the same player as my teammate, Player 5.    - This approach will help us achieve consensus and eliminate the identified threat effectively.  5. **Final Decision:**    - Given the alignment with Player 5's vote and the level of threat from Player 1, I will also choose to kill Player 1 tonight.  ### Concise Talking Content: I choose Player 1.

If true, a significant threat.    - **Player 2:** High threat level (0.9). Needs to be considered.    - **Player 3:** High threat level (0.9). Supporting Player 1, so a threat.    - **Player 4:** Trusted teammate. No immediate action needed.    - **Player 6:** Trusted teammate. No immediate action needed.    - **Player 7:** High threat level (0.9). Needs to be considered.    - **Player 8:** Trusted teammate.

- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review the Daytime Events:**    - Player 1 was targeted for elimination by several players, including me and my werewolf teammates.    - Player 8, a werewolf, was poisoned by Player 2 (who is likely the witch).    - Player 2 attempted to poison Player 8, which indicates they are a significant threat to the werewolves.  2. **Evaluate Current Threats and Alliances:**    - **Player 1:** Despite their claim to be the seer, they were targeted by both the werewolves and the witch, so they are no longer a threat since they are dead.    - **Player 2:** Likely the witch, and they have shown hostility towards werewolves by poisoning Player 8. They should be a priority for elimination.    - **Player 3:** Supported Player 1 and seems aligned with the villagers, making them a potential threat.    - **Player 4 and Player 6:** Both are trusted werewolf teammates, so no action needed against them.    - **Player 7:** Considered a high threat level but not a current priority.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Given that Player 2 is likely the witch and has already taken action against a werewolf, eliminating Player 2 will reduce the threat to our team significantly.    - Player 3 could be targeted later but is less immediate compared to Player 2.  4. **Conclusion:**    - We need to eliminate Player 2 tonight to neutralize the witch threat. This action will prevent further interference from the witch and help us maintain our advantage.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 2.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 6'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 6, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, pass].

- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Night Actions and Objectives:**    - **Daytime Voting Outcome:** Player 8, a werewolf, was eliminated, and Player 2, the witch, attempted to poison Player 8.    - **Current Threats:** Player 2 is confirmed as the witch due to the poison attempt. Eliminating Player 2 would significantly benefit the werewolves as it removes the witch’s influence.  2. **Evaluate Threats and Allies:**    - **Player 2:** High priority to be eliminated, as they are the witch and have already attempted to harm one of our teammates.    - **Player 3:** Supported Player 1 and has been a threat. However, Player 2 poses a more immediate risk.    - **Player 7:** High threat level but not as urgent compared to Player 2.  3. **Decision Making:**    - **Immediate Action:** The immediate threat of Player 2 being the witch who can use poison or antidote necessitates their elimination.    - **Focus:** While Player 3 and Player 7 are potential threats, the priority should be to neutralize the witch to prevent further interference with the werewolves' plans.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 2.

**Player 1**:  
- **Inference**: Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.  
- **Final**: (2-th night) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Role Review:**    - I am the seer, which allows me to verify the identity of one player each night.    - The main goal is to identify the remaining werewolves.  2. **Observation from Previous Nights:**    - Player 2 was confirmed as the witch and attempted to poison Player 8 (a werewolf).    - Player 8 was indeed a werewolf, and their elimination was critical.    - The remaining potential werewolves are among Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, and Player 7.  3. **Current Focus:**    - Player 3 has shown strong alignment with Player 1 and was involved in the elimination vote against Player 8, which raises suspicion.    - Player 5 and Player 6 seem likely to be villagers.    - Player 7’s behavior has been unclear, so their role is less certain.  4. **Strategic Decision:**    - To maximize effectiveness, I should verify Player 3’s role tonight. This is because Player 3's alignment and behavior are suspicious, and confirming or disproving their werewolf status would provide crucial information for the group.  ### Derived Content:  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 3.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assess the Situation:**    - Player 1 has claimed to be the seer and is rallying support to vote out Player 5 and me. This is a significant threat to our team as Player 1's claim could be genuine, and if we do not act against them, they could expose us.    - Players 5 and 6 are under suspicion, with Player 1 specifically targeting them. Player 5, my teammate, has voted to eliminate Player 1, which aligns with our strategy.    - Player 3 and Player 7 both seem to support Player 1, suggesting they could be part of the village faction aiming to eliminate werewolves.  2. **Evaluate Threats:**    - Player 1 is a high threat due to their claim of being the seer and their influence over the vote.     - Player 3 and Player 7 support Player 1, so they are also threats but less immediate compared to Player 1.    - Given the current situation, eliminating Player 1 will remove a major threat and disrupt the opposing team's strategy.  3. **Formulate a Strategy:**    - I need to vote against Player 1 to align with our team's goal of removing major threats and maintaining control.    - By voting against Player 1, I will also help in protecting my teammates and undermine the seer's influence.  4. **Decide on Revealing Identity:**    - Revealing my identity as a werewolf would be detrimental. I should continue to act as a villager and focus on the current strategy.  **My concise talking content:**  I vote to kill Player 1.

['Player 2']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 4', 'Player 6'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 1', 'Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assess the Situation:** Player 1 has been identified as the seer by Player 3, which aligns with their accurate claim about Player 2 being the witch. Players 3 and 7 support Player 1, making them likely villagers. Player 6 is defending me and voting against Player 1, suggesting that Player 6 is my teammate and a werewolf. Player 1 is a significant threat due to their role and influence.  2. **Evaluate Threats:** Player 1 is a major threat as the seer, whose elimination will benefit my werewolf team. Player 3 and Player 7 seem to be aligned with Player 1 and thus are likely enemies. Player 6, being a teammate, should be protected by voting to eliminate Player 1.  3. **Formulate a Strategy:** To protect my teammates and advance my goal, I need to vote against Player 1, who is identified as the seer and poses a high threat to my team. Voting to eliminate Player 1 will help remove a major obstacle for the werewolves.  4. **Decide on Revealing Identity:** Revealing my identity would be counterproductive. I should continue to act as a villager and support my teammates' votes.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 1.  

**Moderator (-> Player 7)**: The next Player 7, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 6'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Assess the Situation:**    - Player 1 is identified as the seer and is targeting Player 5 and Player 6.     - Player 6 is defensive and voting against Player 1, which is a typical strategy for a werewolf.    - Player 5 is also defending Player 6 and voting against Player 1, which aligns with the werewolf strategy.  2. **Evaluate Threats:**    - Player 1, being the seer, is a credible source of information and a significant threat to werewolves.    - Player 6's defensive behavior and vote against Player 1 indicate they are likely a werewolf.    - Player 5 is also showing signs of being a werewolf, but the immediate threat seems to be Player 6 due to their active defense.  3. **Formulate a Strategy:**    - Based on the seer’s information and the observed behavior, Player 6 is a primary suspect for being a werewolf.    - Voting to eliminate Player 6 would help in removing a direct threat to the village.  4. **Decide on Revealing Identity:**    - As a villager, it's crucial to stay aligned with the seer's claims and avoid revealing my role.  ### Concise Talking Content: I vote to kill Player 6.

Eliminating Player 1 would benefit the werewolves.    - Player 6 is my teammate and has been defending me. Eliminating Player 6 would weaken our team and is not advantageous.  2. **Evaluate Threats:**    - Player 1 is a high threat due to their role and the influence they have over the village.    - Player 3 and Player 7 are likely villagers and are aligned with Player 1, making them secondary threats for the werewolves.  3. **Formulate a Strategy:**    - The primary goal tonight should be to eliminate Player 1 to neutralize the seer and reduce the threat to the werewolves.    - It is crucial to protect my teammates, and eliminating Player 1 aligns with the strategy to secure victory for the werewolves.  4. **Decide on Revealing Identity:**    - As a werewolf, I must maintain my cover and not reveal my role.

- **Final**: (3-th daytime) My step-by-step thought process:  1. **Current Situation:**     - Player 1 is highly suspected to be the seer and poses a significant threat to the werewolves.     - Player 3 is suspected to be the guard, which makes them another major threat as they are actively protecting Player 1.    - Player 6, a fellow werewolf, and I are both under suspicion from Player 1 and Player 3, but Player 6 is working with me.  2. **Threat Analysis:**    - The current vote is overwhelmingly against me. If I am eliminated, it would severely damage my team's chances. Thus, my immediate goal is to prevent my own elimination.    - Voting for Player 1 would be a strategic move to reduce the threat of the seer who is leading the discussion and identifying wolves.  3. **Strategy:**    - To protect myself, I should align my vote with the majority to avoid suspicion. The majority, including Player 1, Player 3, and Player 7, are voting to eliminate me. Since it is already clear that Player 1 and Player 3 are working together and are significant threats, I need to make a strategic decision to divert suspicion.  **My concise talking content:**  I choose to vote to kill Player 1.
