1. **Review of Previous Daytime Activity:** Player 1 was eliminated as a werewolf based on the voting. My initial verification and the voting trend support that conclusion.

2. **Trust and Threat Assessment:** Based on previous reflections, I have high trust in Players 3, 7, and 8. Player 4 appears suspicious and potentially dangerous, with a high threat level.

3. **Current Objective:** My main goal is to identify another werewolf. Since Player 1 was confirmed as a werewolf, the remaining wolves are likely among the players who did not vote for Player 1 or who may be trying to manipulate others.

4. **Decision on Verification:** Given the current situation, it is crucial to check the identity of a player who hasn't been verified yet and who may have a significant impact on the game. Player 4 has been flagged as a potential threat, making them a strong candidate for verification.

**My concise talking content:**

   - Player 7 claims to be the guard and protected Player 5.

2. **Analyzing Claims and Roles:**
   - **Player 5 (Seer)**: Claims Player 4 is a werewolf. This is a significant claim, and since the seer can verify roles, their claim should be taken seriously.
   - **Player 8 (Witch)**: Poisoned Player 2. They are potentially trustworthy as they acted against a werewolf (Player 2).
   - **Player 7 (Guard)**: Claims to have protected Player 5, which aligns with the goal of protecting the seer.
   - **Player 1**: Accused earlier but is still alive; their role remains unclear.

3. **Formulating Strategy:**
   - As a werewolf, I need to counteract the claims against me while subtly guiding the discussion.
   - The immediate goal is to create confusion or doubt about Player 5’s claim. I should align with the other werewolf’s (Player 2) death to maintain consistency.
   - Focus on undermining Player 5’s credibility and questioning the logic of their claim.

4. **Preparation for Speaking:**
   - I should point out inconsistencies or potential flaws in Player 5’s claim without outright attacking them.

- **Reflexion**: As the guard, I observed that Player 5 claimed to be the seer and Player 8 claimed to be the witch during the daytime discussion. I think that protecting Player 5 is crucial since they might have valuable information about the werewolves. But I am still unsure about the roles of the other players, so I will not reveal my identity yet.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Reflecting on the discussion, I trust Player 5, Player 8, and Player 4 as my teammates.
2. Player 5, the seer, claims that Player 4 is a werewolf, which aligns with my trust in Player 4.
3. Player 8, the witch, claims to have used their poison on Player 2, which indicates their active role.
4. Player 3 hasn't provided any meaningful information, so I have less information to make a decision about them.

Based on this, I will choose to vote for Player 3 to be killed.

My concise talking content: I vote to kill Player 3.  

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> Player 5)**: The next Player 5, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 7, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 5**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 5, the seer. I trust myself very much.
Player 2 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0

In these players, ['Player 6', 'Player 7'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 1', 'Player 4'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
