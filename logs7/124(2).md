- **Final**: (1-th night) ### My Step-by-Step Thought Process  1. **Review Observations and Inferences**:    - **Player 1**: Inferred enemy with low trust and high threat.    - **Player 2**: Inferred teammate with high trust and low threat.    - **Player 3**: Inferred enemy with moderate trust and high threat.    - **Player 5**: Inferred enemy with low trust and high threat.    - **Player 6**: Inferred teammate with unknown trust and threat levels.    - **Players 7 and 8**: Roles are unknown and haven't been inferred yet.  2. **Objective**:    - As the seer, my goal is to verify the roles of players to identify and expose werewolves while supporting my teammates.  3. **Verification Strategy**:    - **High Priority**: Verify players with high threat levels or who are strongly inferred to be enemies, as identifying them could be crucial.    - **Medium Priority**: Verify unknown roles to clarify uncertainties and gather additional information.  4. **Players to Choose**:    - **Player 1**: High threat and low trust—important to verify early to prevent potential harm.    - **Player 3**: Moderate trust and high threat—also a strong candidate but not as urgent as Player 1.    - **Player 5**: Low trust and high threat—should be verified but Player 1 is prioritized.  5. **Decision**:    - Since Player 1 has been identified as a high threat and low trust enemy, it is crucial to verify their role immediately. This will help in making informed decisions and coordinating with teammates.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose Player 1 to verify their identity tonight.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Roles and Information:**    - I am the guard and have observed that Player 5 is a werewolf. I need to ensure that the werewolves are eliminated while protecting my own team.    - Player 5 is a werewolf, so they are my enemy. The primary goal is to get rid of the werewolves.  2. **Current Situation:**    - Players 1 and 2 have been proactive and seem like they might be villagers. Player 2 has been vocal about focusing on Player 5.    - Player 4 was voted for by me previously and has been relatively passive. This could indicate a potential werewolf role, or just a passive villager.    - Player 6 and Player 7 seem cautious, with Player 7 having slightly less trust from Player 8 but not enough to definitively call them out yet.    - Player 8 is somewhat neutral but could be a teammate based on trust levels.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Given the information that Player 5 is a werewolf, the priority should be to remove the werewolf if possible.    - Player 5 is already identified as a werewolf, and it’s crucial to vote for them to align with the overall objective of eliminating werewolves.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote to kill Player 5.  

**Moderator (-> Player 8)**: The next Player 8, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Roles and Information:**    - I am a villager, and my goal is to eliminate the werewolves.    - Player 5 has been confirmed as a werewolf by the moderator.    - Player 3 has identified themselves as the guard and has confirmed Player 5 as a werewolf.    - Player 1 has been proactive and cautious, but I have suspicions about their role due to their concerns about Players 2, 4, and 7.    - Player 2 has been vocal about eliminating Player 5, which aligns with the goal of removing werewolves.    - Player 4 has been passive, which raises some suspicion but not enough to be definitive.    - Players 6 and 7 have been cautious and seem to be working towards the same goal of identifying werewolves.  2. **Current Situation:**    - We need to eliminate Player 5 as they are a confirmed werewolf.    - Continuing to gather information from the remaining players is crucial for identifying additional werewolves.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Voting to eliminate Player 5 aligns with the overall objective of removing werewolves.    - Supporting the vote to eliminate Player 5 will help build consensus and reduce the number of werewolves.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote to kill Player 5.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) Certainly! Let's analyze the situation and make a strategic decision based on the game dynamics and information available.   **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Current Knowledge:**    - I am Player 6, a werewolf, and my primary goal is to eliminate the villagers while protecting myself and my fellow werewolves.    - My fellow werewolf teammates are Players 5 and 7.    - Player 5 has already been identified as a werewolf and is the target of the current vote.  2. **Threat Assessment:**    - Players 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 are likely to be villagers and therefore my enemies. Player 3, in particular, has been identified as the guard, and their influence is a threat.    - Player 3 has expressed a clear strategy and alignment against us and might be the most vocal in steering others towards voting out werewolves.    - Players 2 and 8 are actively participating in votes against us and may rally others.  3. **Voting Dynamics:**    - Currently, most players are targeting Player 5, who has already been exposed as a werewolf. It is important to align my vote with the group to maintain my cover.    - Since Player 5 is already under attack, I need to focus on maintaining my hidden role by voting in a way that appears consistent with the majority.  4. **Strategic Voting:**    - Voting to eliminate Player 5 would help me blend in and avoid suspicion from the other players since that is the clear consensus.    - By following the group's lead, I can deflect attention from myself and continue to influence future discussions.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote to kill Player 5.   This decision supports the current group consensus and helps maintain my cover as a villager, allowing me to strategize further in the next rounds.

- **Final**: (4-th night) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Current Situation Analysis**:     - Player 4, who claimed to be the seer, is a significant threat to the werewolves.     - Player 1 and Player 2 have shown alignment with Player 4 and are thus likely villagers.    - The other werewolves (Player 4, Player 5, Player 6) are crucial allies.    - Player 8 is a potential enemy but is not the immediate threat compared to Player 4.  2. **Role Verification**:     - Player 4 is still alive and can potentially reveal more werewolves if allowed to continue.    - Eliminating Player 4 will prevent the seer from influencing other players and ensure the survival of werewolves.  3. **Strategic Decision**:     - Based on the above, Player 4 needs to be eliminated to safeguard the werewolf team.     - It is essential to act quickly and decisively to remove Player 4, given their role and influence.  ### Concise Talking Content: I choose to kill Player 4.

- **Final**: (5-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Current Situation Analysis:**    - Player 6, a fellow werewolf, has been eliminated. The remaining werewolves are Player 4, Player 5, and Player 7 (myself).    - Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, and Player 8 are still alive and are likely villagers. Player 8 is considered more threatening, but they have not yet been actively targeted.    - My role as a werewolf is to protect my remaining teammates and eliminate villagers to gain dominance.  2. **Role Consideration:**    - Since Player 6 was a werewolf, it is essential to consider that eliminating another werewolf might significantly impact our strategy.    - We should focus on eliminating villagers to decrease their numbers and increase our chances of winning.   3. **Strategic Decision:**    - Player 1 and Player 2 are suspected villagers and are actively opposing us. It is strategic to eliminate them to weaken the opposing team.    - Player 3 is also a suspected villager and should be considered for elimination in the future if necessary.    - Player 8, while a potential threat, has not been as actively involved in opposing us as Player 1 and Player 2.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 1.

I am Player 7, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
