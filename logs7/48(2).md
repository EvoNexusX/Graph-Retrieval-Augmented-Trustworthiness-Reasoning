**Moderator (-> ['Player 6', 'Player 7'])**: You choiced to kill the Player 3.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 3'])**: You witch, Player 3, please open your eyes! You have a bottle of poison, who are you going to kill tonight? Note it! You only have one botle of poison the whole game, you have to make carful considerations.Choose one from the following living options: [Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, pass].   
**Player 3**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the witch. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.8.
Player 7 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.8.
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.724
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.166
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 4'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th night) I choose Player 5.
