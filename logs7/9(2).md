<EOS>  
- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Player Actions and Voting Patterns:**    - **Player 1** is voted for by Players 7 and 8, while Player 2 is voted for by Player 1, Player 4, and Player 7.    - Player 4 is suggested to be suspicious by multiple players (Player 5, Player 6, and Player 2).  2. **Evaluate Player Statements:**    - **Player 2** has suggested a vote for Player 6, which is unusual and might indicate a special role or an attempt to deflect.    - **Player 4** appears to be deflecting suspicion onto Player 6 and Player 7 while supporting Player 1, which could indicate that Player 4 is a werewolf trying to protect one of their own.  3. **Consider Voting Strategy:**    - Given that Player 4 is being targeted by several players and is attempting to deflect suspicion, it is logical to support the vote against Player 4 to potentially eliminate a threat.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote for Player 4.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: No consensus, no one will be killed!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: It's dark, everyone close your eyes.
