- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Based on the information I observed, I suspect that Player 2 and Player 4 could be werewolves.
2. Player 8, the claimed seer, confirmed that I am not a werewolf, so I trust their judgment.
3. I will vote to kill Player 2, as I suspect they are a werewolf based on the accusations against them.

My concise talking content: I vote to kill Player 2.  

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 2.

Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? <2> My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that the moderator has informed us of the roles of all players. However, I still don't have enough information to determine the roles of other players. I need to work with my teammates to decide who to kill tonight, but I don't know who they have chosen. I should focus on blending in with the other players and avoid revealing my true role.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? My role is not disclosed and I should continue to blend in with the other players without revealing my true role.

The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

Player 3's claim of being confirmed as not a werewolf by Player 8 also adds to their credibility.

What is the current voting count for each player?
Who has been accused of being a werewolf multiple times and why? My reflection in heart (not happened): I don't have the current voting count for each player as it hasn't been mentioned in the chat history. Player 2 has been accused of being a werewolf multiple times because of suspicions raised during the discussion.
Has anyone claimed the role of the werewolf? <2> There are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.
Who has not contributed much to the discussions and seems suspicious to be a werewolf? Player 6: Based on the discussions, Player 8 has not contributed much and seems suspicious to be a werewolf.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them?

No identity clues revealed for other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the villager, I observed that Player 7 claimed to be the witch and used the antidote to save Player 4, which seems credible. Player 3 has been confirmed as not a werewolf by Player 8. However, I have not gathered enough information to confidently reveal my identity at this point. So, I will continue to observe and analyze the situation to help identify the true werewolves among us.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Player 1 has been accused by both Player 5 and Player 8, and they are considered as a werewolf.
2. Player 5 has also been accused, but there is not as strong of evidence against them.
3. Player 3, Player 4, and Player 8 have been trusted by multiple players in the discussion.
4. Based on my own inference, I trust Player 3, Player 4, and Player 8.

Based on this analysis, I choose to vote to kill Player 1 in order to eliminate a suspected werewolf and protect the players with higher trust levels.
