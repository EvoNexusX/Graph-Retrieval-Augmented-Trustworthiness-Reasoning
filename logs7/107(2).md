- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessment of Current Information:**    - Player 4 is consistently identified as a werewolf by myself and Player 6, the guard.    - Player 2 was poisoned by Player 7 (who claims to be the witch), which means Player 2 may be eliminated due to poisoning, so focusing on Player 4 is crucial.    - I have high confidence that Player 4 is a werewolf, supported by Player 6's guard claim.  2. **Confirmation of Votes:**    - Player 2 and Player 4 have both been targeted. Player 2 was poisoned by Player 7, which may lead to their elimination regardless of today's vote.     - Given the current consensus and the need to prioritize eliminating clear werewolf threats, Player 4 should be the focus.  3. **Decision to Vote:**    - The most pressing threat is Player 4, as identified by me and confirmed by Player 6. Voting to eliminate Player 4 aligns with our objective of removing werewolves.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 4.

- **Final**: (3-th night) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Current Situation Review:**    - **Player 2**: Poisoned by me and might be eliminated soon, which aligns with the fact that they are a werewolf.    - **Player 5**: Claimed to be the seer and correctly identified Player 4 as a werewolf, thus a trusted ally.    - **Player 6**: Identified as the guard, supported Player 5’s claim, and is considered a trusted ally.    - **Player 3 and Player 8**: Considered trustworthy based on my previous inference.    - **Player 1**: Has a moderate trust level, but needs more evaluation.  2. **Remaining Threats:**    - **Player 4**: Already eliminated.    - **Player 2**: Should be eliminated soon due to poisoning, but I still have one poison left to use.    - **Player 5 and Player 6**: Both are confirmed allies.  3. **Decision-Making:**    - Since Player 2 will likely be eliminated due to poisoning, using the poison on another potential werewolf could be more strategic.    - Player 1 has a moderate trust level and needs evaluation. However, Player 2 is confirmed as a werewolf.    - Given the high threat level of Player 2 and the fact they might be eliminated due to my previous action, it would be strategic to use the poison against a more uncertain target or someone who might be a threat.  4. **Final Decision:**    - Considering the available information and the need to target potential threats while maintaining the safety of allies, using the poison on Player 1 can be a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the team if Player 1 shows any signs of being a werewolf.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose to poison Player 1.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 7'])**: Failed, your poison has run out!

['Player 2']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.

In these players, ['Player 3', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 4', 'Player 7', 'Player 1'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (3-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Current Situation:**    - Player 4, a confirmed werewolf, was eliminated.    - Player 2 was poisoned by Player 7, who is likely the witch based on their actions.    - Player 6 is confirmed as the guard and has protected me, so their claim seems credible.    - Player 7 is suspected of being a werewolf, and Player 1 is also a suspected werewolf based on previous information.  2. **Role Confirmation:**    - As the seer, my role is crucial in verifying the identities of the remaining players.    - Player 3 and Player 8 are considered trustworthy based on my initial assessment and the support of Player 6.  3. **Decision for Verification:**    - Player 7 has already demonstrated suspicious behavior by poisoning Player 2. Verifying Player 7's role will provide clarity on whether they are a werewolf or the witch.    - Player 1 remains a concern but has not been as prominently discussed as Player 7 in recent discussions.  4. **Strategic Choice:**    - Confirming Player 7's role will help us determine if they are a werewolf, which will assist in our strategy to eliminate the remaining threats.    - Verifying Player 7 is critical because if Player 7 is a werewolf, it confirms a significant threat and helps guide our daytime voting strategy.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to verify Player 7.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5'])**: Player 7 is not a werewolf!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: The sun rose. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.

**Moderator (-> all)**: Now you Player 2 are asked to choose which of the players should be voted for killing based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 2, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 2**:  
- **Inference**: Player 2 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.  
Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3.  
Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.4 and his level of threat to me is 0.6.  
Player 7 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.  
- **Final**: (3-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessment of the Situation:**    - Player 5 has claimed to be the seer and pointed out Player 2 (me) as suspicious. If Player 5 is telling the truth, they are a significant threat.    - Player 6 claims to be the guard and is supporting Player 5's claim. If Player 6 is also truthful, they pose a threat to me.    - Player 7 claims to be the witch and has used poison on me. They could be a major threat if they can poison me again or if they are indeed a witch.  2. **Evaluating Threats and Allies:**    - If Player 5 is indeed the seer, their elimination would be beneficial since they are identifying me as a werewolf.    - Player 6, if the guard, is trying to protect Player 5, which aligns them against me.    - Player 7’s use of poison against me signals they are actively working to neutralize me. This makes them a critical target.  3. **Choosing the Target:**    - Given the roles and their actions, eliminating Player 5 would remove a significant threat if they are the seer. This could also disrupt the alliance against me.    - Player 7’s direct attack on me with poison makes them a key target, but eliminating Player 5 first can weaken the opposing side’s strategy.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 5.  

**Moderator (-> Player 5)**: The next Player 5, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 2, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...

- **Final**: (3-th daytime) My step-by-step thought process:  1. **Review of Current Situation:**    - Player 5, claiming to be the seer, has identified Player 2 as a werewolf and has been supported by Player 6, who claims to be the guard and guarded Player 5.    - Player 2 is actively trying to deflect suspicion by targeting Player 5, indicating they are a werewolf.    - Player 7 (me) used poison on Player 2 last night, which aligns with the claims made by Player 5 and Player 6.  2. **Evaluation of Voting Patterns:**    - Player 2 is attempting to create confusion by targeting Player 5. Their behavior indicates they are a werewolf.    - Both Player 5 and Player 6 have consistently supported the idea of eliminating Player 2.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Player 2 has been poisoned by me last night, which should lead to their elimination if the poisoning takes effect. This aligns with the consensus to eliminate Player 2.  4. **Conclusion:**    - Given the voting patterns and the fact that Player 2 has been poisoned, voting to eliminate Player 2 is the logical choice to eliminate a known threat.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 2.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 2 will be killed! You can make a brief last statement.
