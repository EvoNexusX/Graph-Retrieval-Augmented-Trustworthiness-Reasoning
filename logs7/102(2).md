- **Final**: (1-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluate Team Trust:**    - Player 5: Confirmed werewolf, so I trust them completely.    - Player 8: Confirmed werewolf, so I trust them completely.  2. **Assess Threats:**    - Player 3: Identified as a potential enemy and was voted to be killed by Player 5. Given the trust in Player 5 and that Player 3 is a known threat, Player 3 should be eliminated to remove a significant threat to our team.  3. **Confirm Choices:**    - Player 3 was voted for by a fellow werewolf (Player 5). It is consistent to follow this vote and eliminate Player 3 to minimize risk and align with my teammates' decision.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 3.

**Player 4**:  
- **Inference**: Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.  
- **Final**: (1-th night) ### My Step-by-Step Thought Process  1. **Identify Player 3's Situation**:     - As the witch, I observed that Player 3 was targeted by the werewolves. This implies Player 3 might be a threat or at least a significant target for the wolves.    - Since I chose not to use the antidote to save Player 3, it indicates that Player 3's role could be less critical for me to protect at this moment.   2. **Analyze the Threat**:    - My trust level in Player 3 is very low (0.2), and their threat level to me is quite high (0.8). This suggests that Player 3 is likely to be a werewolf or an adversary of some sort.  3. **Consider Future Actions**:    - Since I have not used my poison yet and given the high threat level from Player 3, it makes sense to use my poison to eliminate a player who poses a high threat, especially if I am unable to identify other werewolves with certainty.  4. **Evaluate Other Options**:    - If I choose to pass, I would lose the opportunity to act against a suspected enemy, which could be critical.     - Considering my high threat level and low trust in Player 3, it seems strategically prudent to use my poison against them.  ### My Concise Talking Content I choose to poison Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 2'])**: You seer, Player 2, please open your eyes! Who are you going to verify its identity tonight? Choose only one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Reflect on the Chat History:** From the chat history, I observed significant suspicion directed towards Player 2, while Player 4 also faced strong consensus for elimination. Given that my reflection indicates suspicion towards Player 2 and since my role as the guard allows me to protect players, I need to decide carefully whom to vote against.  2. **Analyze the Suspicion and Consensus:** There’s a strong consensus to eliminate Player 4, which suggests that many players view Player 4 as suspicious. However, there is notable suspicion towards Player 2, who is likely a werewolf given their attempt to deflect blame.  3. **Consider My Role and Strategy:** As the guard, I need to be cautious about revealing my role. Voting for Player 2, who has significant suspicion against them, aligns with my personal judgment of Player 2 being a werewolf. This will help me blend in with the majority and avoid drawing suspicion.  4. **Evaluate the Risk and Benefit:** If I vote against Player 4, I would align with the majority, but I believe Player 2 is more likely to be a werewolf based on my observations. Hence, voting for Player 2 is strategically sound as it targets a likely werewolf.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote to kill Player 2.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) ### My Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Analyze the Current Votes:**    - **Player 4** has received votes from Player 6 and Player 8, while Player 2 has votes from Player 1 and potentially others.    - **Player 5** has only received a vote from Player 4, which seems less significant compared to the strong consensus on Player 4.  2. **Evaluate Threat Levels:**    - Player 2 is a significant threat as per my inference and has a lower threat level than Player 5.    - Player 4 is a teammate and a trusted ally, so I should protect Player 4 if possible.  3. **Consider the Strategic Position:**    - Eliminating Player 4 might not be ideal for the werewolves as it would reduce the number of allies and strengthen the position of the villagers.    - Supporting the elimination of Player 4 will align with the current consensus and reduce suspicion.  4. **Plan for Optimal Outcome:**    - Voting to eliminate Player 4 would align with the current votes and help maintain my cover as a villager.    - Given that Player 4 is a teammate, it’s important to balance between maintaining cover and protecting teammates.  ### My Concise Talking Content:  I choose to vote to kill Player 4.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Identify Key Players and Their Roles:** I am certain that Players 7 and 8 are my teammates, as they voted to kill Player 2 with me. Players 1, 5, and potentially others are villagers who are working together against us.   2. **Review the Situation:**     - **Player 1:** Being attacked by multiple players and is the main focus of suspicion. This aligns with our goal of eliminating villagers.    - **Player 5:** Also a villager and was included in the general suspicion against Player 1, but less focus was placed on them compared to Player 1.  3. **Determine the Best Target:** Since Player 1 is currently the primary target and facing strong opposition, they are a logical choice for elimination. Eliminating Player 1 will likely shift focus away from me and my teammates.  4. **Consider the Votes and Discussions:**    - Player 1 is the main target and is being supported by Player 5, who has a lower level of suspicion compared to Player 1.    - By aligning with the majority vote to eliminate Player 1, I avoid drawing attention to myself and stay in sync with my teammates.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 1.

**Player 8**:

The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessment of Player 1:** Player 1 is facing significant suspicion from multiple players, and Player 6, who I know is a teammate, is strongly pushing to eliminate Player 1. This alignment with my teammates’ strategy suggests that Player 1 is a villager or a threat to us.  2. **Review of Voting Dynamics:** Player 5 is also a villager and is supporting the suspicion against Player 1. Given that Player 1 is the primary target, aligning with this vote will help ensure that Player 1 is eliminated, maintaining my cover and supporting my teammates.  3. **Comparison with Other Players:**     - **Player 5:** While Player 5 is also a villager and a potential threat, the focus is on Player 1 right now. Voting against Player 5 could shift suspicion toward me and disrupt our current strategy.    - **Player 6:** As a known teammate, Player 6's vote to eliminate Player 1 aligns with our goals. It is crucial to stay in sync with them to avoid suspicion and protect our team.    - **Player 7:** Player 7 is quiet but has not been directly involved in the vote against Player 1, making them less of a priority compared to the immediate threat of Player 1.  4. **Strategic Decision:** Since Player 1 is the most immediate threat to our strategy and aligns with the current voting focus, it is beneficial to vote for Player 1 to increase our chances of eliminating a villager.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 1.

**Player 7**:

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 5'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review of Current Situation:**     - The majority of players, including Player 6 and Player 8 (both of whom I know are my werewolf teammates), are focused on eliminating Player 1. Player 1 is seen as the primary threat and is being defended against by Players 5 and 6.     - Since Player 1's defensive actions and attempts to shift focus make them a strong candidate for being the seer, eliminating them would be beneficial.  2. **Review Voting Dynamics:**    - Player 6 and Player 8 are my werewolf teammates, and their votes are aligned with eliminating Player 1.    - Player 5 is also a villager and is supporting the vote against Player 1, which aligns with our strategy.  3. **Strategic Decision:**    - Since Player 1 is under significant suspicion and aligning with the vote to eliminate them avoids drawing suspicion towards me and supports our team’s goal, it is strategically sound to vote for Player 1.    - Voting for Player 1 maintains our alignment with my teammates and helps achieve the goal of removing a major threat.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 1.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 6', 'Player 7', 'Player 4'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th daytime) My step-by-step thought process:  1. **Assess the Situation:**    - Player 1 is the main target of suspicion from Players 6, 7, and 8, all of whom are likely werewolves based on their coordinated votes and arguments. Player 1 has been defensive, which aligns with behavior of a potential werewolf trying to protect themselves.  2. **Review Voting Dynamics:**    - Player 1 is facing the majority of votes, and it is in alignment with the observations from other players that Player 1 might be a werewolf.    - Player 5 (myself) is a villager and aligning with the majority vote against Player 1 supports our goal of eliminating a potential werewolf.  3. **Strategic Decision:**    - Given that the majority of players are focused on Player 1 and their defensive behavior seems suspicious, it is important to support the vote against Player 1 to eliminate the immediate threat.  4. **Maintain Cover:**    - Voting to eliminate Player 1 aligns with my goal of removing a potential enemy and helps in protecting my identity as a villager while supporting the correct strategy.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 1.
