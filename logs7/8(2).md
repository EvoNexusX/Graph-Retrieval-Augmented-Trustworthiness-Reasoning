- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Role Analysis:** Player 2 claimed to be the witch and led the vote against Player 6, who was successfully eliminated. If Player 2 is truly the witch, they are a threat because they have the ability to save someone targeted by us or poison one of us.  2. **Allegiance Consideration:** Player 1 and Player 7 seem aligned with the werewolf team based on their voting patterns during the daytime. Player 8 followed the group decision to vote out Player 6, so they could be a neutral or a cautious villager.  3. **Target Selection:** Eliminating Player 2 would prevent the use of the antidote and poison, which could hinder our plans. However, if we kill Player 2 and they are the witch, the witch's poison might be used posthumously on one of us. Alternatively, we could consider eliminating another player like Player 1 or Player 8, but Player 2 remains the most immediate threat.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 2.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 7'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 7, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, Player 7, Player 8, pass].
