- **CoT**: Step-by-step thought process:
1. As a werewolf, I need to make a convincing last statement to avoid being eliminated.
2. I should try to create doubt and suspicion among the other players to deflect attention from myself.
3. I need to avoid revealing my true role while also not accusing anyone too strongly, as that could backfire.

My concise talking content:
"I believe we should consider all possibilities before making a decision. Let's not rush into accusing anyone without solid evidence. There may be more to this than meets the eye, and we should be cautious about making hasty judgments."  

- **Final**: I believe we should consider all possibilities before making a decision. Let's not rush into accusing anyone without solid evidence. There may be more to this than meets the eye, and we should be cautious about making hasty judgments.
