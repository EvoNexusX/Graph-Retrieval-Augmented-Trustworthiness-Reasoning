Gathering information from these interactions will help me strategize for the next night.
Since the moderator mentioned that the witch has antidote and poison, how can we use this information to our advantage as werewolves? What strategies can we employ to mislead the other players and protect ourselves during the game? We can use the information about the witch's abilities to mislead the other players by pretending to be targeted by the wolves and then having the witch use the antidote on me. This can create confusion and divert suspicion away from the actual werewolves. Additionally, we can try to identify the witch and eliminate them to remove the potential threat of the antidote.
