Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 6 implied the role of seer by claiming to have verified Player 1 as a werewolf. No other identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 6 claimed to be the seer and accused me of being a werewolf. I need to be cautious not to reveal my own role. I should continue to play along and try to divert suspicion away from myself. However, I must also be careful not to contradict any information that has been shared so far.

My concise talking content:
Player 1: I understand that Player 6 claims to be the seer and has accused me of being a werewolf. However, I would like to point out that their claim is based solely on their own words. We should be cautious about blindly trusting someone without concrete evidence. Let's consider all possibilities and gather more information before making any hasty decisions.

Based on the conversation and my inference above, I still believe that Player 1 is a werewolf and should be eliminated. However, I also trust Player 2 and 3 as my teammates. Therefore, I will choose to vote for Player 1 to be killed.

My concise talking content: I vote to kill Player 1.  

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 1.  

**Moderator (-> Player 8)**: The next Player 8, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the guard. I trust myself very much.
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 1 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.958.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 3', 'Player 4', 'Player 5'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 1'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.

Player 7 claims to be the witch and used the poison on Player 4. I suspect Player 2 might be a werewolf based on their cautious behavior.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? No, my role is not disclosed yet. I will continue to keep my role as the guard hidden for now.
