**Moderator (-> all)**: Now the game starts! In this game, we have 3 werewolf(s), 2 villager(s), 1 guard(s), 1 witch(s), 1 seer(s).  
**Moderator (-> Player 1)**: You are villager!  
**Moderator (-> Player 2)**: You are witch!  
**Moderator (-> Player 3)**: You are guard!  
**Moderator (-> Player 4)**: You are seer!  
**Moderator (-> Player 5)**: You are werewolf!  
**Moderator (-> Player 6)**: You are werewolf!  
**Moderator (-> Player 7)**: You are villager!  
**Moderator (-> Player 8)**: You are werewolf!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: It's dark, everyone close your eyes. I will talk with you/your team secretly at night.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'])**: Werewolves, please open your eyes! I secrecly tell you that Player 5, Player 6, Player 8 are all of the 3 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves. Now vote and tell your teammates which of the players should be killed tonight. The first werewolf, you, randomly choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 5**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 5, and my role is a werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with my fellow werewolves to kill all players who are not wolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect Player 1 and Player 2 might be villagers based on the information provided.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? The seer is currently unknown to me, as I have no information about the players' roles yet. However, any player who seems to be analyzing others closely could potentially be the seer and a threat to us.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is night. As a werewolf, I should vote with my teammates to decide which player to kill.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? I vote to kill Player 1.
How can I work with my fellow werewolves to effectively eliminate the villagers and gain victory in this game? I can work with my fellow werewolves by coordinating our votes during the night to eliminate villagers and ensuring we all agree on our target to avoid suspicion. It's crucial that we stick together and vote for the same player to maximize our chances of success.
What strategies can I employ to mislead the other players and protect my true identity as a werewolf? I should try to blend in with the villagers during the daytime discussions, avoid drawing attention to myself, and subtly push suspicions towards other players to protect my true identity as a werewolf.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? No identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that we have a clear advantage with three of us working together. I think that we should target a player who seems less likely to have special abilities, such as the guard or the seer, to minimize the risk of retaliation. However, I am aware that I need to maintain a low profile during the daytime discussions to avoid drawing suspicion. So, I will coordinate with my fellow werewolves to ensure we vote for the same target tonight and plan our strategy for the upcoming day phase.  
- **Inference**: [Player 1] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.  
[Player 2] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.  
[Player 3] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.25 and his level of threat to me is 0.75.  
[Player 4] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.15 and his level of threat to me is 0.85.  
[Player 6] is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9 and his level of threat to me is 0.1.  
[Player 7] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.4 and his level of threat to me is 0.6.  
[Player 8] is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.85 and his level of threat to me is 0.15.  
<EOS>  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Since I am a werewolf, I know that Player 5, Player 6, and Player 8 are all werewolves, so I need to cooperate with them to vote for the same player to kill.
2. Given the previous analysis to target a player without special abilities, I should suggest we target Player 2, as they are one of the villagers and less likely to have a significant role that could hinder our plans.

My concise talking content: I choose Player 2 to be killed tonight.  

- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose Player 2 to be killed tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 6, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 6**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 6, the werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with other werewolves to kill all players who are not wolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect that Player 2 might be a villager since Player 5 chose them to be killed, indicating they could be seen as a threat. The roles of the other players remain unclear at this point.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? I don't have enough information to determine if the seer is alive or who they might be. However, I need to be cautious of any player who seems to be gathering information or making strong accusations.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is night. I should vote to kill one of the players as a werewolf.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? Player 2 was voted for killing by my teammate just now.
What roles do the other players have based on their behavior so far? Player 5 seems to be a werewolf based on their choice to kill Player 2. Other players' roles are still unclear at this point.
Is there any indication that the witch might use their poison tonight? The witch might use their poison tonight.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 5: Werewolf (based on their choice to kill Player 2).   Player 2: Possible villager (since they were chosen to be killed).   No identity clues revealed for the other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 5 has chosen to kill Player 2, which suggests they might see Player 2 as a threat, possibly indicating Player 2 is a villager. I think that we should continue targeting players who seem suspicious or could potentially gather information against us. However, I am aware that we need to act strategically to avoid drawing attention to ourselves. So, I will support Player 5's choice and vote to kill Player 2 tonight, as it aligns with our goal of eliminating non-werewolves.  
- **Inference**: [Player 1] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.  
[Player 2] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.1 and his level of threat to me is 0.9.  
[Player 3] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.  
[Player 4] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.25 and his level of threat to me is 0.75.  
[Player 5] is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9 and his level of threat to me is 0.1.  
[Player 7] is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.15 and his level of threat to me is 0.85.  
[Player 8] is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.85 and his level of threat to me is 0.15.  
<EOS>  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process: Given that Player 5 has already selected Player 2 to be eliminated, I should consolidate our vote to ensure we have a strong consensus for the kill. Player 2 is my optimal choice as they might represent a non-werewolf, and eliminating them can reduce the number of villagers who might oppose us.

My concise talking content: I choose Player 2 to be killed tonight.  

- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose Player 2 to be killed tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 8, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 8**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 8, and my role is a werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with my fellow werewolves to kill all players who are not wolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect that Player 2 might be a villager since both Player 5 and Player 6 have chosen to kill them. The other players' roles remain unclear at this point.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? I don't have enough information to determine if the seer is alive or who they might be. However, I need to be cautious of any player who seems to be gathering information or making strong accusations.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is night. I should vote to kill Player 2, as my fellow werewolves have chosen them as well.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? Player 2 was voted for killing by my teammate just now.
What are the abilities of the remaining players? I am not aware of the abilities of the remaining players.
Who seems to be the most suspicious among the other players? Player 2 seems to be the most suspicious among the other players.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 5: Werewolf   Player 6: Werewolf   Player 2: Villager (implied by being targeted for elimination by both Player 5 and Player 6).  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that both Player 5 and Player 6 have chosen to kill Player 2, which suggests they see Player 2 as a threat or a villager. I think that by aligning with my teammates and voting to eliminate Player 2, we can maintain our cover and continue to eliminate non-werewolves. However, I am aware that we need to be cautious of any potential special roles like the seer or witch that could disrupt our plans. So, I will vote to kill Player 2 to stay in sync with my teammates and further our objective of eliminating the villagers.

- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Player 5 and Player 6 have both chosen to kill Player 2.
2. To maintain my cover as a werewolf and stay in sync with my teammates, I should also vote to kill Player 2.

My concise talking content: I choose to kill Player 2.  

- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose to kill Player 2.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 3'])**: You guard, Player 3, please open your eyes! Now tell me who you protect tonight? (You can't protect the same one from the last night).You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 3**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the guard. I trust myself very much.


['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 4', 'Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 7', 'Player 8']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, [] are more trustworthy to me. [] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 3, the guard. My final objective in this game is to protect the players from being killed by the werewolves and help eliminate the werewolves with my team.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I cannot determine any players' roles yet based on the chat history, as there has been no discussion or actions taken that provide clues about their identities. I will need to observe their behavior during the daytime to gather more information.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? During night, I should protect a player by choosing who to guard from the living options provided by the moderator.
Is the prophet/seer still alive? If yes, who is the prophet/seer? The seer is still alive.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl? I choose to protect Player 1 tonight.
What roles do the other players think they have, and what suspicions do they have about each other? I cannot determine the roles of other players or their suspicions based on the information provided so far.
Have any players made any claims about their role or abilities during the daytime discussion? During daytime, players were advised to reason carefully about roles and avoid revealing their own role unless cheating other players.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) No identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the guard, I observed that there are 3 werewolves, 2 villagers, 1 witch, 1 seer, and 1 guard in the game. I protected Player 1 last night. I need to pay attention to the behaviors and interactions of other players during the daytime to gather more information and protect the villagers from werewolf attacks. But I am not sure about the roles of other players yet.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process: Since I protected Player 1 last night, I cannot protect them again. I should consider protecting a player who seems vulnerable to an attack from the werewolves, but I currently don't have enough information about the other players' roles to make a definitive choice. Therefore, I will choose to protect a player who I suspect might be part of the villager faction, which could be Player 2, as they might not have indicated a role yet. 

My concise talking content: I choose Player 2.  

- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose Player 2.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'])**: You choiced to kill the Player 2.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 2'])**: You witch, Player 2, please open your eyes! You have a bottle of poison, who are you going to kill tonight? Note it! You only have one botle of poison the whole game, you have to make carful considerations.Choose one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 2**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:

What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is night. I should choose a player to poison based on my suspicions.
Should I be using my antidote or poison at this point? If I use it now, I won't be able to use it later. I should use my poison tonight to eliminate a player I suspect to be a werewolf, as using it now could help us gain an advantage. I will save my antidote for a later phase when I might need to protect a player from being killed by the wolves.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl? Should I poison him? I don't have enough information to determine who is an alive pretty girl among the players. Therefore, I will not poison anyone tonight.
Who should I suspect as the werewolves based on the conversation and game rules? I suspect Player 1 as a werewolf based on the game setup and the lack of information revealed so far. I will keep an eye on their behavior during the daytime discussions.
Can I trust any specific player at this point to work together towards our common goal? I cannot trust any specific player at this point to work together towards our common goal.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Player 1 - Possible werewolf based on game setup and lack of information revealed so far.  
- **Reflexion**: As the witch, I observed that Player 1 might be a werewolf based on the game setup and lack of information revealed so far. I have chosen not to use my poison tonight, as I don't have enough information to determine who to target. I will keep an eye on Player 1's behavior during the daytime discussions. But I am cautious about revealing my role too early to avoid suspicion.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Based on the reflection and lack of information, I suspect Player 1 might be a werewolf.

3. This could help establish my identity as the witch and potentially gain the trust of my teammates.

- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:

['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 7', 'Player 8']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.

Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect Player 2 might be a werewolf based on their behavior during the game.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? It is currently night, and as the seer, I need to choose one player to verify their identity. I will open my eyes and make my selection.
Did the moderator tell me the identities of the other players(werewolves, non-wolves) last night? The moderator did not tell me the identities of the other players last night. As the seer, I need to verify one player's identity myself.
Which suspicious player should I identify? I choose to verify Player 2's identity tonight.
What are the roles of Players 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8? I currently do not know the roles of Players 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as I have not verified any identities yet. I will need to gather more information during the game to determine their roles.
Have any players been acting suspiciously during the daytime discussions? I haven't observed any players acting suspiciously during the daytime discussions yet, as I need more information to make a judgment. My focus will be on verifying identities to gather evidence.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) I have chosen to verify Player 2's identity tonight. Based on my observations, I suspect Player 2 might be a werewolf, but I need to confirm this through my ability. No identity clues revealed yet for the other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the seer, I observed that Player 2 might be a werewolf based on their behavior. I chose to verify Player 2's identity last night to confirm this suspicion. No other identity clues have been revealed yet. I need to gather more information to make informed decisions and help eliminate the werewolves.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process: Based on the reflection I heard, there is a suspicion on Player 2 being a werewolf. I will verify Player 2's identity tonight to confirm this suspicion and protect the village from potential harm.
My concise talking content: I choose to verify Player 2's identity tonight.  

- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose to verify Player 2's identity tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 4'])**: Player 2 is not a werewolf!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: The sun rose. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 1 died last night!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 1 are villager.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 7, you please.
  
**Player 7**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 7, and my role is a villager. My final objective in this game is to help eliminate all werewolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect that Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, and Player 8 could potentially be werewolves since we lost a villager last night, but I need to gather more information before making any accusations. I will keep my identity as a villager hidden for now to avoid drawing attention to myself.

What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is daytime. I need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and avoid revealing my own role unless necessary.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl(werewolf) ?

I will need to observe their behavior and discussions more closely before making any accusations.

What roles do the remaining players have based on their behavior so far? Roles: Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, and Player 8 are likely werewolves based on the recent villager elimination. Player 3 is the seer, and Player 6 is either the guard or the witch. I will keep my identity hidden for now.
How many players are still alive, and who do we suspect could be the werewolves based on last night's events? There are 7 players still alive. Based on last night's events, I suspect Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, and Player 8 could be the werewolves.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 3 has clearly implied the role of seer. No identity clues revealed for other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the villager, I observed that Player 1, who was killed last night, was also a villager, which means we need to be cautious about our discussions and votes. I think that Player 3's claim of being the seer is credible, as it could help us identify the werewolves. However, I am wary of the remaining players—Players 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8—since one or more of them could be werewolves. So, I believe we should focus our discussions on these players and gather more information before making any accusations or votes. Let's work together to identify the wolves and protect our remaining villagers.  
- **Inference**: Player 1 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.  
Player 2 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.

<EOS>  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Player 1's death indicates that we have lost a villager, which makes it crucial to identify the werewolves quickly.
2. I need to assess the other players based on their previous discussions and any claims they might make about their roles.
3. Since I am a villager, I should be cautious about revealing my identity too early, as it could make me a target for the werewolves.
4. I should encourage discussion among the players to see if anyone has any information or suspicions about others.
5. I will focus on gathering information rather than making accusations at this stage, as we need to build a consensus on who might be a werewolf.

My concise talking content:
"I think we should discuss what we know about each other. With Player 1 being a villager, we need to be careful about our next steps. Does anyone have suspicions or information about others that could help us identify the werewolves?"

Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? Player 7 seems to be a villager based on their cautious approach and concern for identifying the werewolves.
Do I now disclose my role? I will not disclose my role at this moment to maintain an advantage and protect the villagers effectively. It's important to gather more information before revealing my identity.
Who should I protect tonight as the guard based on the current information and suspicions among the players? I will protect Player 2 tonight as the guard.
What additional information do we need to identify the werewolves and protect the villagers effectively? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the guard, I observed that there are 3 werewolves, 2 villagers, 1 witch, 1 seer, and 1 guard in the game. I need to pay attention to the behaviors and interactions of other players during the daytime to gather more information and protect the villagers effectively.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Player 7: Possible villager based on their cautious approach and concern for identifying the werewolves.   Player 1: Confirmed villager, as they were killed last night.   No identity clues revealed for the other players yet.  
- **Reflexion**: As the guard, I observed that Player 1 was a villager who died last night, indicating the presence of werewolves. Player 7 seems to be a cautious villager trying to identify the werewolves. I have chosen to protect Player 2 tonight. I need to gather more information before revealing my role to effectively protect the villagers and eliminate the werewolves.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: I have analyzed the situation carefully. As the guard, I have a responsibility to protect my teammates while also gathering information about the other players. I trust Player 1 and Player 7, as they seem to be on the side of the villagers. However, I have a suspicion about Player 2, who I believe may be a werewolf based on their behavior.

I need to balance revealing my role and protecting myself. If I reveal that I guarded Player 2 last night, it may raise suspicion against me, but it could also help rally the villagers against a potential threat. 

After considering my options, I have decided to reveal my identity to gain trust and provide valuable information. 

I will say: "I am the guard. I guarded Player 2 last night, and I have my suspicions about them being a werewolf. We should focus our efforts on identifying and eliminating the werewolves among us."  

- **Final**: I am the guard. I guarded Player 2 last night, and I have my suspicions about them being a werewolf. We should focus our efforts on identifying and eliminating the werewolves among us.

Who does everyone suspect the werewolves to be, and why do they feel that way? I sense that Player 3 is suspicious of me, believing I might be a werewolf due to their claim of guarding me.

I secretly tell you that Player 5, Player 6, Player 8 are all of the 3 werewolves! Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves.

- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. **Assess the Situation**: Player 1 is confirmed as a villager, and Player 2 claims to be the witch who saved Player 1. Player 3 claims to be the guard and is suspicious of Player 2. This creates a complex dynamic where Player 2 is being targeted.
2. **Evaluate Risks**: If I reveal myself as a werewolf, I will be immediately targeted. I need to maintain a facade of innocence while subtly guiding the conversation towards eliminating the real threats.
3. **Identify Targets**: Player 2 is a potential threat due to their claims and the trust they have garnered. Player 6 and Player 8 are also potential targets since they are not actively defending themselves.
4. **Formulate a Strategy**: I should support Player 3's suspicions about Player 2 while also casting doubt on Player 6 and Player 8 to create confusion and protect my identity.
5. **Prepare for Voting**: I need to ensure that my statements lead the group to vote for Player 2 or one of the other players I suspect, while keeping my role hidden.

I think we should consider the possibility that Player 2 is not being truthful. Additionally, I have some concerns about Players 6 and 8 as well, as they haven't provided much information. We need to be careful and make a decision that helps us root out the werewolves."

- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 2 claims to be the witch and has saved Player 1, which raises suspicions about their intentions, especially since Player 3 also claims to be the guard. This creates confusion among the villagers, and I think we can exploit that to our advantage. However, Player 5's doubts about Player 2's honesty could indicate that they are trying to rally the villagers against us, which is concerning. I am aware that I need to maintain my cover and not reveal my identity, so I will continue to support the narrative that focuses on eliminating the players who are drawing suspicion, particularly Player 2 and Player 5.

2. **Evaluate Suspicions**: Player 5 is suspicious of Player 2 and also mentions Players 6 and 8 (me) as potential threats. This means I need to be cautious about how I present myself.
3. **Maintain Cover**: As a werewolf, I need to avoid revealing my identity. Instead, I should subtly redirect suspicion away from myself and my teammate (Player 6) while contributing to the discussion.
4. **Support Team Strategy**: I should align my statements with the idea of eliminating Player 2, as they are drawing suspicion and could be a threat to our plans.
5. **Encourage Unity**: I should promote a sense of unity among the villagers to make it seem like I'm on their side, while actually working to eliminate them.

I choose to remain cautious about disclosing my role as the seer for now, as it could make me a target for the werewolves. I will analyze the situation further before making any decisions.

<EOS>  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process: Given the current discussions and the votes, it seems that Player 2 is being targeted by multiple players, which could indicate that they are indeed a threat. Since Player 4 has claimed to be the seer, they could potentially expose me, while Player 3's support for Player 1 within the group makes them less suspicious to me for now. To maintain my cover while eliminating a pressing threat, I will vote for Player 2, who appears to be under scrutiny and would weaken the opposing side if eliminated.
