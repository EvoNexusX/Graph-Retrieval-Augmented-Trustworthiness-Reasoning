- **Final**: (1-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Understanding My Role:** As the guard, my primary function is to protect a player from being killed by the werewolves.

These players are the most likely to be targeted by the werewolves.  3. **Considering the Roles:** Since I don't have exact information on who the werewolves are yet, protecting someone who has a high threat level could prevent a critical loss.   4. **Avoiding Mistakes:** I cannot protect the same player from the last night, but since this is the first night, this restriction does not apply yet.   5. **Deciding Whom to Protect:** To maximize the impact of my protection, I should choose a player with a high threat level, as they are more likely to be targeted. Among the highest threat levels, I will pick Player 5.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 5.

You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 1**:  
- **Inference**: Player 3 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.85 and his level of threat to me is 0.15.
Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.4 and his level of threat to me is 0.6.

Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.  
- **Final**: (1-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Review the Current Situation:**    - **Player 3:** Targeted by wolves but saved by my antidote; likely an ally.    - **Player 4:** Strong suspect of being a werewolf; my trust level is low and threat level is high.    - **Player 5:** Previously poisoned, confirmed as a villager; they are not a threat.    - **Player 6:** Inferred as a teammate; high trust level and low threat level.  2. **Assess the Game Dynamics:**    - **Player 4** has the highest threat level and lowest trust level; they are likely a werewolf.    - **Player 5** is not a werewolf based on previous information.    - **Player 6** is likely a teammate and should be protected for strategic reasons.    - **Player 3** is an ally based on saved status.  3. **Make the Decision:**    - **Player 4** is the most likely werewolf based on threat assessment and low trust. Eliminating Player 4 will reduce the werewolf threat and help secure the win for the non-werewolf team.  ### Concise Talking Content: I choose to vote to kill Player 4.  

**Moderator (-> Player 4)**: The next Player 4, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 4**:  
- **Inference**: Player 2 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.745 and his level of threat to me is 0.255.

Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.691 and his level of threat to me is 0.309.
Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust  
- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Role Analysis**: As the guard, my primary role is to protect key players and ensure the survival of villagers and special roles. Revealing my role would make me a target for wolves, so I need to remain discreet.  2. **Player Trust Levels**: Based on my inferred trust levels:    - Player 2, Player 3, and Player 5 are my teammates with relatively high trust levels.    - Player 4 (myself) is a guard, so I have no suspicions to raise against myself.    - Player 6 is also a teammate, though the trust level is slightly lower than others.    - Player 1, Player 7, and Player 8 are less clear in terms of trust and threat levels.  3. **Suspicion and Strategy**: From the previous discussions, Players 2, 6, and 8 have shown suspicion towards me, which could be a strategy to divert attention away from themselves or might indicate that they are wolves. Player 3 has been making logical deductions, and Player 1 has not been a primary source of suspicion, so they seem less likely to be wolves.  4. **Decision**: Based on the suspicion from Players 2, 6, and 8, and considering my role as the guard, it's important to act strategically. Since Player 2 and Player 6 have relatively high trust levels (from what I’ve deduced), it’s prudent to consider other suspects with lower trust.  5. **Choice**: Since Player 8's suspicion and lack of trust suggest a potential threat, and there's no solid evidence pointing to other players as clear enemies, I choose Player 8 for elimination.  **My concise talking content**: I choose Player 8.

- **Final**: (3-th night) My step-by-step thought process:  1. **Review Roles and Trust Levels:**    - Player 1: Trusted teammate with a moderate threat level.    - Player 2: Trusted teammate with a higher threat level.    - Player 4: Suspicious enemy.    - Player 6: Very suspicious enemy.    - Player 7: Trusted teammate.  2. **Consider Verification Importance:**    - Since Player 4 has a high level of threat, it’s crucial to verify their role to either confirm or dispel the suspicion.    - Player 6 also poses a significant threat and could be another candidate for verification, but Player 4’s role is currently more ambiguous and needs addressing to gain clarity.  3. **Decide Verification Target:**    - Verifying Player 4 will provide crucial information about their true role, which will significantly influence the strategy for the upcoming daytime discussions and decisions.    - Knowing whether Player 4 is a werewolf will help us identify other potential threats and guide our actions more effectively.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to verify Player 4.

- **Final**: (3-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Player Analysis:** Based on the conversation, Player 1 is likely the seer due to their attempt to direct attention and avoid revealing too much. This is supported by the discussion patterns and the high threat level I've assigned to Player 1.     2. **Current Votes:** Player 1 and Player 4 have opposing votes: Player 1 votes to kill Player 3, while Player 4 votes to kill Player 2. Player 2 also voted to kill Player 4, which might suggest Player 2 is trying to eliminate a potential threat.  3. **My Objective:** As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate enemies and protect my identity. Player 1 poses a significant threat because they might be able to identify us, so removing Player 1 would be advantageous.  4. **Current Status:** The majority of votes seem scattered, but Player 1's high threat level makes them a primary target to remove to weaken the opposing faction and improve our chances.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 1.

**Moderator (-> Player 3)**: The next Player 3, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 2, Player 3, Player 7, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...

Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.
Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.  
- **Final**: (4-th daytime) I choose to vote to kill Player 7.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 7 will be killed! You can make a brief last statement.  
**Player 7**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 7, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.96.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 1'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Game over, the villager [1, 4]、the witch [0]、the guard [3] and the seer[2] wins!
