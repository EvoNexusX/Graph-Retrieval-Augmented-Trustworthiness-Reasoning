<EOS>  
- **Final**: (2-th night) My step-by-step thought process: - Player 4 was suspected by Player 1 and chose to eliminate Player 2 during the daytime, which could indicate suspicion towards Player 2. - Player 3 voted to kill Player 1 during the daytime, which could suggest Player 3 is not a werewolf.  Considering these factors: I choose to use the poison on Player 2 tonight to increase the chances of eliminating a werewolf.
