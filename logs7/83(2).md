- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review of Previous Daytime Activity:** Player 1 was eliminated as a werewolf based on the voting. My initial verification and the voting trend support that conclusion. This suggests that some players who voted against Player 1 might be trustworthy, though it could also include wolves trying to blend in.  2. **Trust and Threat Assessment:** Based on previous reflections, I have high trust in Players 3, 7, and 8. Player 4 appears suspicious and potentially dangerous, with a high threat level.  3. **Current Objective:** My main goal is to identify another werewolf. Since Player 1 was confirmed as a werewolf, the remaining wolves are likely among the players who did not vote for Player 1 or who may be trying to manipulate others.  4. **Decision on Verification:** Given the current situation, it is crucial to check the identity of a player who hasn't been verified yet and who may have a significant impact on the game. Player 4 has been flagged as a potential threat, making them a strong candidate for verification.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to verify Player 4.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **Step-by-Step Thought Process:**  1. **Understanding the Current Situation:**    - **Confirmed Roles:**      - Player 1 and Player 4 are confirmed as werewolves.      - Player 2 was poisoned by Player 8, the witch, and is dead.      - Player 7 is the guard who protected me last night.      - Player 8 is the witch, who used their poison last night.  2. **Current Observations and Inferences:**    - Player 5 (myself) is the seer and has confirmed Player 4 as a werewolf.    - Player 3 is being targeted by Player 7 and seems to be suspected but is not confirmed yet.    - Player 7, Player 8, and Player 3 are currently the main discussion points, with Player 7 voting to kill Player 3.  3. **Evaluation of Voting:**    - **Player 7's Vote:**      - Player 7 is the guard and has shown alignment with the seer's claim, but their vote against Player 3 might be a misjudgment or strategic play.    - **Player 8's Position:**      - Player 8, the witch, has used poison and is trusted to some extent since they have already acted against the werewolves.  4. **Decision Making:**    - Player 4 is confirmed as a werewolf and needs to be eliminated. Since Player 7’s vote is against Player 3 and my own observation is that Player 4 is a werewolf, it is essential to focus on removing Player 4 to continue with our strategy.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 4.
