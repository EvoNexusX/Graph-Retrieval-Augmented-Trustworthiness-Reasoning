- **Final**: (1-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:** 1. **Reflection on Previous Night**: I noted that Player 1 and Player 2 did not align their votes, which could lead to no kill if there's no consensus among the werewolves. Ensuring coordination among us is crucial to successfully eliminate a non-werewolf.  2. **Teammate Identification**: Based on my inference, Player 2 is highly likely to be my teammate. Aligning my vote with Player 2's choice can improve our chance of eliminating a non-werewolf and reduce suspicion.  3. **Threat Assessment**: Player 5 is considered an enemy with a significant threat level (0.7). Eliminating Player 5 can weaken the opposing faction and reduce the risk to the werewolves.  4. **Coordination**: Since Player 1 chose Player 5 and I suspect Player 2 to be my teammate, it’s strategic to vote for Player 5, aligning with Player 1’s choice to ensure a kill.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 5.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 6'])**: You guard, Player 6, please open your eyes! Now tell me who you protect tonight?

The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose to protect Player 7 tonight.

**Player 5**:

- **Final**: (1-th night) ### My Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Identifying the Target:**    - I have been informed that Player 5 (myself) was targeted by the werewolves for elimination tonight. This indicates that the werewolves consider me a significant threat, which is a critical piece of information for my strategy.  2. **Choosing to Use the Antidote:**    - Since I am the witch and have a bottle of antidote, my primary goal should be to save myself to continue gathering information and using my abilities effectively.    - If I don't use the antidote on myself, I will be eliminated and unable to contribute further to the game. Given that I am a crucial role with the ability to either protect or poison, it is vital to ensure my survival.  3. **Considering the Game Dynamics:**    - Since I am the witch, using the antidote on myself is a strategic choice to maintain my role in the game. No information about other players' identities is available yet, so protecting myself is the immediate priority.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose to use the antidote on myself to ensure my survival and continue contributing to the game.

**Player 6**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 6, the guard. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessment of the Situation:**    - Player 2, who was a werewolf, has been eliminated. This removes an immediate threat.    - Player 8, who claimed to be the seer, has correctly identified Player 2 as a werewolf, which increases their credibility.  2. **Evaluating Players:**    - Player 1, Player 3, Player 4, and Player 7 are the remaining players. Player 4 has been identified as a werewolf and should be targeted for elimination soon.    - Player 5's claim of being the witch is still somewhat unverified, but they are likely a teammate based on the overall situation.    - Player 8 is the seer and should be protected as their role is critical for identifying werewolves.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Since Player 8 is a valuable asset and has been correctly identified as the seer, protecting Player 8 is essential to ensure their safety and continue their role in identifying werewolves.    - I should not protect Player 5 as I need to verify their role further and protecting Player 8 is a higher priority to safeguard the seer.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to protect Player 8.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluating Player 5’s Claim:**    - Player 5 claimed to be the witch and admitted to poisoning Player 4. This action was unexpected since Player 4 was already identified as a non-werewolf by Player 8, the seer. This raises suspicion about Player 5's intentions and could suggest they are trying to mislead the group.  2. **Corroboration of Claims:**    - Player 8, who is the seer, has confirmed Player 4 was not a werewolf. Since Player 8 is highly credible, Player 5’s behavior is indeed suspicious. Player 3 also expressed suspicion towards Player 5, aligning with the group's general sentiment.  3. **Protecting Key Players:**    - Given Player 8’s crucial role as the seer and their correct identification of Player 2 as a werewolf, protecting Player 8 remains a high priority. As the guard, I should focus on ensuring Player 8’s safety.  4. **Daytime Voting Decision:**    - Based on the consensus and observations, Player 5’s actions have raised significant doubts about their loyalty. Voting to eliminate Player 5 aligns with the group's current strategy and eliminates a potential threat.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 5.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluating Roles and Claims:**    - Player 6 claims to be the guard and confirmed that they guarded me, which aligns with my observations as the seer. They appear trustworthy.    - Player 5 claims to be the witch but admitted to poisoning Player 4, whom I confirmed as not a werewolf. This action is highly suspicious as it contradicts known information and raises doubts about Player 5's true role.    - Player 7 supports my claim as the seer and has not exhibited suspicious behavior.   2. **Suspicion Analysis:**    - Player 5's claim of being the witch and the decision to poison Player 4, who was identified as not a werewolf, casts significant doubt on their allegiance. This suggests Player 5 might be trying to mislead the group.  3. **Strategic Decision:**    - Given the strong suspicion around Player 5 and the group's general agreement, focusing on eliminating Player 5 aligns with the goal of identifying and removing potential werewolves.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 5.

**Moderator (-> all)**: It's dark, everyone close your eyes.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 3'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 3, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 3, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 3**:  
- **Inference**: Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.
Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.
Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9 and his level of threat to me is 0.1.  
- **Final**: (3-th night) **Step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review of Known Roles and Allegiances:**    - As the werewolf, you know Player 8 is the seer, which is a significant threat to the werewolf faction. Eliminating the seer will weaken the non-werewolf side's ability to identify werewolves.    - Player 6 is identified as a guard, which means Player 6's protection could be a concern, but since you are a werewolf, the goal is to remove threats to your faction.    - Player 7 has been quiet and is less of an immediate threat compared to Player 8 and Player 6.     - Your trust levels show that Player 5 is an enemy, Player 6 is a teammate, and Player 8 is a teammate.   2. **Strategic Decision:**    - Since Player 8 is the seer, removing them is crucial as their ability to identify werewolves poses a serious threat to your faction.    - Player 6, although a guard, is not as pressing to eliminate at this moment compared to the seer.    - Player 7, being quiet and less of a threat, is not a priority for elimination right now.  3. **Aligning with Teammates:**    - As the werewolf, it’s essential to coordinate with your fellow werewolves. According to your reflection, Player 8 is a teammate, but as a seer, their elimination is still a priority to ensure they don’t reveal werewolves' identities.    - Ensure that your vote aligns with the werewolf team’s strategy, which currently aims to remove Player 8.  **Concise Talking Content:** I choose Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 6'])**: You guard, Player 6, please open your eyes! Now tell me who you protect tonight? (You can't protect the same one from the last night).You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 3, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 6**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 6, the guard. I trust myself very much.

Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.96
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (3-th night) ### My Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Assess the Previous Night's Protection:**      - Last night, I protected Player 8, who is confirmed as the seer and has been a crucial ally by correctly identifying non-werewolves.  2. **Current Game Situation:**      - Player 5, who claimed to be the witch, was eliminated due to suspicious behavior. The remaining players are Player 3, Player 6 (myself), Player 7, and Player 8.  3. **Protection Strategy:**      - Player 8 cannot be protected tonight as I protected them last night. I need to choose between Player 3, Player 7, and myself (Player 6).  4. **Evaluation of Players:**      - **Player 3**: No significant suspicions raised against them; appears to align with the group's goals.    - **Player 7**: Also has not shown suspicious behavior and seems supportive of the seer's claims.    - **Player 6 (myself)**: As the guard, I am a valuable role, but protecting myself may be less strategically valuable than protecting potential key players like Player 3 or Player 7.  5. **Decision:**      - Since protecting myself could seem selfish and Player 3 and Player 7 both appear to be good players, I will protect Player 3, as they may be targeted next by werewolves to reduce our team's numbers.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose to protect Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: The sun rose. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 8 died last night!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 7, you please.
  
**Player 7**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 7, the villager. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.

- **Final**: (3-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluating the Current Situation:**    - Player 6 claims to be the guard and has been consistently trying to eliminate Player 3, which raises suspicions about Player 3's true role.    - Player 3 is questioning Player 6's role and suggesting they might be misleading, which could be a tactic to draw attention away from themselves.    - Player 6's focus on Player 3 aligns with the idea of eliminating potential threats, given that Player 8, who was a seer, was killed last night.  2. **Assessing the Claims:**    - Player 6 has been protecting Player 8, and their actions seem consistent with their claimed role.     - Player 3's attempts to deflect suspicion and question Player 6 could indicate that Player 3 is trying to hide their true identity, which might be that of a werewolf.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Based on the discussions and the patterns of behavior, Player 3 appears to be the most suspicious. Their focus on discrediting Player 6 and their attempt to redirect suspicion away from themselves suggest that Player 3 might be a werewolf.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> Player 6)**: The next Player 6, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 3, Player 6, Player 7, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 6**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 6, the guard. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0

Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (3-th daytime) I choose to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> Player 3)**: The next Player 3, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 3, Player 6, Player 7, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 3**:  
- **Inference**: Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.745 and his level of threat to me is 0.255.
Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.632 and his level of threat to me is 0.368.
Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.189 and his level of threat to me is 0.811.  
- **Final**: (3-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Assess the Current Situation:**    - **Player 6**: Is claiming to be the guard, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. My reflection suggested that Player 6 might be trying to mislead us.    - **Player 7**: Focused on eliminating me, which might indicate they are trying to protect Player 6 or shift suspicion away from themselves.  2. **Identify Teammates:**    - **Player 6** and **Player 7** are inferred as teammates based on my previous analysis and interactions.  3. **Prioritize Targets:**    - Given that Player 7 is actively working against me and has a lower level of trust compared to Player 6, it makes sense to target Player 7. Eliminating Player 7 would reduce the immediate threat and potential complications for my role as a werewolf.  4. **Review Voting Options:**    - **Player 3**: That’s me, so not a choice.    - **Player 6**: Potentially misleading us, but not the immediate threat.    - **Player 7**: Actively working against me and focusing on eliminating me.  ### Concise Talking Content: I choose Player 7.
