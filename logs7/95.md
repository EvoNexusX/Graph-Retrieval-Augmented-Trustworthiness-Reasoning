- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 5 has claimed to be the seer and has expressed suspicions towards me and Player 4. Player 8 aligned with Player 5's suspicions, and Player 7 has claimed to be the witch. Player 6 seems to be the guard based on their claim of protecting Player 5.   Given the consensus against me, it is clear that I need to continue to align with my teammates’ vote to avoid suspicion. To achieve my objective, I should vote to kill Player 2, as it will maintain the facade of cooperating with the majority. This will allow me to avoid immediate elimination while continuing to work with my fellow werewolves to achieve our goal.   Thus, I will vote to kill Player 2.
