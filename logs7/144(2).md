- **Final**: (1-th night) ### My Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Role and Objective Understanding**: As the guard, my role is to protect a player from being killed by werewolves. My objective is to protect non-werewolf players and help eliminate werewolves.  2. **Previous Decision**: Last night, I protected Player 1 based on limited information. I cannot protect the same player consecutively.  3. **Observations**: Since this is the first night, there is no public information about other players' actions or roles. My decision must be based on assumptions and initial feelings.  4. **Strategic Considerations**:    - Player 1 was protected last night and is still an unknown entity.    - Players 2, 5, and others are unknown as well, but I had an initial suspicion towards Players 2 and 5 based on an arbitrary sense of threat (not fact-based).    - There is no basis for who might be targeted by the werewolves.  5. **Decision Criteria**:    - Avoid protecting suspicious or potentially harmful players (those I initially felt uneasy about).    - Prioritize protecting a player who might be valuable or seems less likely to be a werewolf.  6. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of solid information, I should choose someone who seems neutral or less suspicious to me at this stage.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose to protect Player 4 tonight.

This might suggest that the provided inference might not align with the actual situation or may be biased.  3. **Consider the Information**:    - I need to base my vote on the information I know. Given that Player 1 is confirmed to be not a werewolf, and I suspect Player 5 due to their suspicious behavior and the given context.  4. **Decision**:    - Based on my observations and the inferences, the safest bet is to vote for Player 5, who seems to be the most suspicious and potentially harmful.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose Player 5.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluate Current Situation:**    - The majority of players are focused on Player 5, who has been under suspicion from several players.    - Player 4, who is likely the seer based on their knowledge of Player 1’s innocence, has also pointed to Player 5 as suspicious.    - Based on the discussion, it appears that Player 5 is the main target for elimination.  2. **Review My Role and Strategy:**    - As a werewolf, I need to align with my teammates and avoid drawing attention.    - My teammates include Player 5 and Player 7. It is crucial to support Player 5 in the vote to avoid suspicion and eliminate a non-werewolf.    - From the information provided, Player 4 is suspected to be the seer. Therefore, it is beneficial to eliminate Player 5 to align with the majority and not reveal my role.  3. **Decision:**    - Voting against Player 5 will maintain my cover and support the werewolf team’s objective.    - It will also prevent suspicion from being directed towards me and my teammates, allowing us to continue manipulating the game.  **My concise talking content:**  I vote to kill Player 5.

Player 8, identified as a werewolf, is also pushing for Player 5's elimination, suggesting that Player 5 might indeed be a good target.   4. **Decision**: Given the strong consensus and the evidence suggesting Player 5's suspicious behavior, along with the fact that Player 8, a werewolf, is supporting this vote, it is wise to follow the majority and vote against Player 5.  **My concise talking content**: I choose to vote for Player 5.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Analysis of Situation:**    - **Consensus:** Most players, including Player 4 (likely the seer) and Player 8 (a werewolf), are voting for Player 5. This indicates a strong consensus and that Player 5 is viewed as suspicious by the majority.    - **Roles:** Players who have voted for Player 5 include:      - Player 4 (suspected to be the seer based on their knowledge of Player 1).      - Player 6 and Player 8 (both seem to be aligned with Player 5 in their voting pattern, making Player 5 the target).    - **Role Information:** As a werewolf, my goal is to align with the werewolf team and protect them while eliminating the villagers.  2. **Current Evidence:**    - Player 5 is targeted for elimination by most players, and the seer's knowledge supports this choice.    - Player 8, a known werewolf teammate, is supporting the vote against Player 5. This is suspicious but aligns with maintaining cover as a werewolf.  3. **Decision:**    - Since Player 5 is heavily targeted and the majority is voting to eliminate them, it's crucial to follow the

- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assess the Current Situation:**    - Player 4 is highly suspected to be the seer because of their ability to confirm Player 1’s innocence and their active participation in discussions.    - Eliminating Player 4 would weaken the villagers' ability to identify the werewolves, as the seer can reveal key information about werewolf identities.  2. **Team Strategy:**    - Player 7, a werewolf teammate, has already suggested killing Player 4, aligning with the goal of removing the seer.    - It is important to maintain a unified front with my werewolf teammates to ensure that we achieve consensus on our target.  3. **Threat Assessment:**    - Player 4 is a direct threat due to their suspected role as the seer and their influence in directing other players' suspicions.    - Eliminating the seer will reduce the risk of the werewolves being discovered in subsequent rounds.  4. **Decision:**    - By voting to eliminate Player 4, we remove a significant threat, maintain alignment with Player 7, and further the werewolf agenda without drawing suspicion to ourselves.    - The other players, particularly Player 1, Player 2, and Player 6, will become targets in future rounds if they continue to pose threats.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 4.
