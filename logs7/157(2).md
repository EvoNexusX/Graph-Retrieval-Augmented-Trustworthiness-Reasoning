**Moderator (-> Player 1)**: The next Player 1, you, continue talking with other players based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.  
**Player 1**:  
- **Inference**: Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2.  
Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7.  
**Moderator (-> Player 8)**: The next Player 8, you, continue talking with other players based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection.  
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the guard. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Now you Player 5 are asked to choose which of the players should be voted for killing based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 3, Player 5, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...
