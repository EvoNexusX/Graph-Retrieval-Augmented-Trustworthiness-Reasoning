- **Final**: (1-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Identify the Consensus:** From the previous votes, Player 5 chose Player 4, and Player 6 chose Player 3. Since I am a werewolf and should work with my teammates, I need to align my vote with theirs.  2. **Evaluate Threat Levels:** According to my inference, Players 3 and 4 are both enemies. The fact that Player 6 is targeting Player 3 suggests they might be considered a higher threat or a priority for elimination.  3. **Choose the Best Target:** Given that Player 6 has chosen Player 3 and this aligns with our strategy, it makes sense for me to support this choice. Aligning with my teammates helps maintain unity and effectiveness in our actions.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 3.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **Step-by-Step Thought Process:**  1. **Assess the Current Situation:**    - **Player 4** is being heavily targeted by multiple players, including Player 3, who seems to be actively identifying threats and could be the seer.     - **Players 7 and 3** are considered enemies, and both are pushing for Player 4’s elimination.    - As a werewolf, my primary goal is to ensure the elimination of players who are enemies and to protect my werewolf teammates.  2. **Evaluate the Voting Trends:**    - **Player 7** and **Player 3** are both voting for Player 4, indicating a consensus against them.    - **Player 4** is a suspect but has been identified as a potential werewolf in my internal inference, so keeping the focus on Player 4 aligns with my strategy.  3. **Determine the Best Course of Action:**    - Given that Player 4 is targeted by multiple players, including those who seem to have some insight (possibly Player 3 as the seer), voting for Player 4 would align with the consensus and blend with the group’s sentiment.    - This will help avoid suspicion from other players and keep my werewolf identity hidden while also potentially removing a threat.  **Concise Talking Content:**  I choose to vote to kill Player 4.  

**Moderator (-> Player 4)**: The next Player 4, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assess the Voting Patterns:**    - Player 4 is receiving votes from Players 3, 6, and 7. Player 4 is also being targeted by these players, which aligns with the consensus to eliminate them.   2. **Evaluate Player Threat Levels:**    - Based on my reflection, Player 4 is less of a threat compared to Players 1, 3, and 7. They have been identified as a villager by several players and might be less of an immediate threat compared to other players.  3. **Determine Strategy:**    - As a werewolf, my primary goal is to align with the group sentiment to avoid suspicion and further the elimination of players who pose a threat to my team. Since Player 4 is being targeted and Player 6 is one of my teammates, I need to vote in line with the consensus to maintain my cover.  4. **Choose the Best Option:**    - Given the voting trend and the need to protect my werewolf allies, continuing the vote against Player 4 is a sound strategy. It blends with the current focus and avoids suspicion.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 4.

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Role Analysis:** From the previous discussions and voting patterns, it is clear that Player 6 and Player 8 are likely werewolves. Player 7 is considered a villager by some and is being targeted by Player 6 and Player 8, which makes Player 7 a potential threat to the werewolves.  2. **Behavior and Voting Patterns:**    - **Player 6:** Voted to kill Player 7. Player 6's behavior aligns with my role as a werewolf, making Player 6 a reliable teammate.    - **Player 8:** Also voted to kill Player 7. Player 8's alignment with Player 6 further suggests they are both werewolves.    - **Player 7:** Is being targeted by the werewolves (Players 6 and 8) and has been identified as a potential threat by Player 1, which indicates Player 7 might be a villager.  3. **Current Situation:**    - To protect my fellow werewolves and create confusion, it is crucial to vote in line with my teammates. Player 7 is currently a significant target by the werewolves and is a likely villager.  4. **Conclusion:** To maintain the strategy and align with the werewolves, voting to kill Player 7 will continue the deception and protect my team.   **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote to kill Player 7.
