In these players, ['Player 2'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (1-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluate Last Night's Action:**    - The werewolves targeted Player 2, whom I saved using the antidote. This suggests Player 2 might be a valuable role such as the seer or the guard, which the werewolves see as a threat.  2. **Determine Who to Poison:**    - Since Player 2 was targeted, it's likely that the werewolves are already focusing on eliminating players with important roles. Therefore, it's crucial to identify and target potential werewolves.    - As of now, there’s no concrete evidence from the daytime discussion about which players are werewolves.   3. **Making the Decision:**    - Since there is no additional information about other players’ roles yet, the best course of action is to pass on using the poison tonight. This allows me to gather more information during the daytime discussion and make a more informed decision.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to pass on using the poison tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 8'])**: You seer, Player 8, please open your eyes! Who are you going to verify its identity tonight? Choose only one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessing the Situation:**    - **Player 8 (Me):** As the seer, I have identified Player 3 as a werewolf. Despite conflicting claims from others, my primary goal is to eliminate the werewolves.    - **Player 5:** Claims to be the guard and protected Player 3, which complicates the situation. However, Player 5's role as the guard seems credible given Player 6's support.    - **Player 6:** Claims to be the witch and supports Player 5's claim. This raises concerns about their trustworthiness, but they seem aligned with the village.    - **Player 7:** Supports my claim of Player 3 being a werewolf. This indicates alignment with my goal.    - **Player 4:** Is a known werewolf. Based on the previous votes and my knowledge, Player 4 is a significant threat and must be eliminated.    - **Player 2:** Has supported Player 5 and is somewhat suspicious, but Player 4 is a more immediate threat.  2. **Evaluating Votes and Claims:**    - Player 3 has been targeted by multiple players, including Player 7 and myself. However, Player 5’s protection claim conflicts with this, suggesting either deception or a misunderstanding.    - Player 4 is a known werewolf and should be prioritized for elimination to reduce the threat.  3. **Decision Making:**    - To maintain alignment with the village and remove the werewolf threat, I should vote to eliminate Player 4, as Player 4 is a confirmed werewolf and poses an immediate threat to the village.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 4.
