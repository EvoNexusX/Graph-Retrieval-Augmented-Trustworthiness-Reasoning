Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 5', 'Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? My player name is Player 8 and my role is the werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with my teammates to kill all players who are not wolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I think Player 6 might be a werewolf based on their voting pattern and the previous accusations. I need to be cautious about revealing my identity as a werewolf at this point.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that Player 3 was voted to be eliminated, which aligns with my suspicion that they might be the seer. However, I am still unsure about the roles of the other players. So, I will continue to observe and gather more information before revealing my identity.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? During nighttime, I should discuss with my werewolf teammates and vote to kill one player based on our analysis and consensus.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? I choose to kill Player 7.
**Who has the witch used the antidote or poison on, if at all?** The witch has used the antidote on Player 7.
Who has the guard protected, if anyone, and who will they protect tonight? The guard has protected Player 7, and they will protect Player 6 tonight.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Player 6 - Werewolf Player 7 - No identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 6 has consistently voted in alignment with my suspicions. I think that we should continue to work together to eliminate the other players. But I am Player 8, so I need to be cautious about revealing my identity as a werewolf.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
Based on my earlier reflections and inferences, I suspect that Player 7 is a good person, but Player 6 is my teammate, a werewolf. Therefore, I will vote to kill Player 7 tonight.

My concise talking content:
I choose to kill Player 7 tonight.  

- **Final**: (4-th night) I choose to kill Player 7 tonight.
