My concise talking content: I choose to kill Player 4.  

- **Final**: (3-th night) I choose to kill Player 4.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 8'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 8, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 8, the werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with the other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 6, you please.
Is the seer alive? Yes, the seer is likely still alive.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? It is currently night.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? I choose to kill Player 4.
**Who did the witch save or poison in the previous night?**
**Is the guard still alive and who did they protect last night?** I don't have enough information to determine who the witch saved or poisoned in the previous night, or if the guard is still alive and who they protected last night.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Player 1 - No identity clues revealed. Player 3 - No identity clues revealed. Player 4 - No identity clues revealed. Player 5 - No identity clues revealed. Player 7 - No identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that no identity clues have been revealed for any of the players. I think that we should continue targeting suspicious players for elimination. But I am not a villager, so I need to be careful in how I present my suspicions and observations. So far, I haven't received any information from my teammates, so I will vote to kill Player 4 based on my own analysis.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
Based on the previous conversation, Player 4 and Player 5 were both targeted for elimination during the daytime discussion. However, my own inference suggests that Player 4 is a werewolf and should therefore be protected. Additionally, Player 7 has been identified as a potential threat in both my own inference and a previous vote to eliminate them. Therefore, I will choose to kill Player 7 tonight.

My concise talking content:
I choose to kill Player 7 tonight.  

- **Final**: (3-th night) I choose to kill Player 7 tonight.
