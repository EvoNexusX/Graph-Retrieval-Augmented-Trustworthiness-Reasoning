- **Final**: (3-th daytime) My step-by-step thought process: 1. Player 2 claimed to be the witch and accused Player 5 of being a werewolf, which seems like a logical move. 2.

Considering the information provided, I choose to vote to kill Player 4. They have shown trust in a player accused of being a werewolf, which could indicate they are not aligned with our faction.
