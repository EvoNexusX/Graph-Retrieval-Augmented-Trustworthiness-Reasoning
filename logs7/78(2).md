**Moderator (-> ['Player 6', 'Player 8'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 8, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 2, Player 6, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.065
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.824.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.8.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 5', 'Player 2'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (5-th night) I choose to vote to kill Player 2 tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 2'])**: You guard, Player 2, please open your eyes! Now tell me who you protect tonight? (You can't protect the same one from the last night).You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 2, Player 6, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 2**:  
- **Inference**: Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.
Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.4 and his level of threat to me is 0.6.  
- **Final**: (5-th night) I choose to protect Player 8 tonight.
