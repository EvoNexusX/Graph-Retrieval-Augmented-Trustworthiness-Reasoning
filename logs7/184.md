Keep in mind you are teammates. The rest players are not werewolves. Now vote and tell your teammates which of the players should be killed tonight. The first werewolf, you, randomly choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 5**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 5, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0

Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 6', 'Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 3', 'Player 4', 'Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 5, and I am a werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with the other werewolves to eliminate all players who are not wolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I cannot guess other players' roles based on the chat history.

Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? My player name is Player 5 and my role is a werewolf. My final objective in this game is to cooperate with the other werewolves to eliminate all players who are not werewolves.

- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that my fellow werewolves are Player 6 and Player 8. I think that we need to work together to eliminate the other players.

- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: Since I am a werewolf, I know that Player 6 and Player 8 also are my teammates. Based on my previous inference, I should suggest eliminating Player 4. He is an enemy to me, and eliminating him could strengthen our position. So, I will suggest Player 4 to my teammates.

My concise talking content: I choose to eliminate Player 4.  

- **Final**: (1-th night) I choose to eliminate Player 4.
