I need to think about my player name, role, and final objective in this game. From the chat history, I can see that Player 5 and Player 7 both voted to eliminate Player 3, which could indicate that they are werewolves like me. My role is not disclosed, so I should continue to hide my identity. My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that both Player 5 and Player 7 voted to eliminate Player 3, which aligns with our werewolf strategy. But I am a villager, so I need to continue to hide my true identity and subtly influence the discussion to protect my fellow werewolves.
What roles do Player 5 and Player 7 have? Player 5 and Player 7 are both werewolves.
Can anyone provide any evidence or information that can help us identify the werewolves?

I think that Player 3 and Player 4 are being suspected as werewolves, which aligns with our strategy. But I am a villager, so I need to continue to hide my true identity and subtly influence the discussion to protect my fellow werewolves.

Who got killed by a werewolf last night? Did I use the antidote and the poison? I used the poison on Player 3 last night, and they were killed by a werewolf.
Should I be using my antidote or poison at this point? If I use it now, I won't be able to use it later. I should not use my antidote or poison at this point.

1. Based on my observation, Player 7 strongly implied being the seer.
2. Player 1 and Player 8 haven't revealed any significant information to help identify their roles.
3. Since I am the witch, I want to keep the suspicion away from myself, so I should not vote for Player 7.
4. Player 2 is my teammate, so I should not vote for them.

Therefore, I will vote to kill Player 8 as I don't have any solid evidence about their role.

My concise talking content: I vote to kill Player 8.  

- **Final**: (4-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 2 will be killed! You can make a brief last statement.  
**Player 2**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 2, and I am the witch. My final objective in this game is to use my abilities to help eliminate the werewolves and ensure the victory of the villagers and my team.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect Player 7 to be the seer based on their strong implication in the conversation. I will continue to keep my identity as the witch a secret for now.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? My role as the witch is not disclosed, and I will continue to keep my identity a secret for now.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? During daytime, I need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be cautious not to reveal my own role unless necessary.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl? Should I poison him? Based on the conversation and my inference, Player 7 is most likely to be the alive pretty girl. I should not poison him tonight.
Should I be using my antidote or poison at this point? If I use it now, I won't be able to use it later. I should not use my antidote or poison at this point.
What are the voting results for the elimination of Player 2, and who voted for whom?
What were the reasons behind the suspicions towards Player 8, and what actions or statements led to these suspicions? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the witch, I observed that both Player 7 and Player 8 voted to eliminate Player 2. The suspicions towards Player 8 were based on their repetitive statements and lack of new information.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 7 has clearly implied being the seer based on the conversation. No identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the witch, I observed that both Player 7 and Player 8 voted to eliminate me, which raises suspicions about their intentions. I suspect Player 7 to be the seer based on their strong implication in the conversation. However, I need to be cautious and not reveal my identity. I will continue to observe and gather more information before making any final decisions.  
- **Inference**: Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3.
Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8.
Player 7 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.6.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. I need to make a convincing statement to defend myself and try to shift suspicion onto someone else.
2. I should avoid revealing my role as the witch, as it could make me a target for elimination.
3. I should try to create doubt about the accusations against me and redirect attention to another player.

My concise talking content:
"I understand that there may be suspicions about me, but I assure you that I am not a werewolf. I have been observing the conversations closely, and it seems that Player 7 has been very vocal in accusing me without any solid evidence. I believe we should focus our attention on Player 7 and investigate their role further. Let's not rush to judgment and consider all possibilities before making a decision."  

- **Final**: I understand that there may be suspicions about me, but I assure you that I am not a werewolf.
