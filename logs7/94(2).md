This indicates a consensus among the werewolves, and it aligns with our goal of eliminating enemies.  2. **Confirm Strategy:**    - As Player 8 (a werewolf), my role is to support the decision of my werewolf teammates to ensure that the right target is selected. Since Player 5 and Player 7 have chosen Player 2, it’s prudent for me to vote in alignment with their choice to maintain cohesion and prevent suspicion.  3. **Assess the Situation:**    - The information from the night phase indicates Player 2 is targeted by both of my werewolf teammates, suggesting Player 2 is indeed an enemy (likely a villager or special role opposing us).  4. **Confirm Decision:**    - To keep the strategy consistent and to avoid drawing attention to myself or creating discord within the werewolf team, I should follow the plan and vote to kill Player 2.  ### Concise Talking Content I choose to kill Player 2.
