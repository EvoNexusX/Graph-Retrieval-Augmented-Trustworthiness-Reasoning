- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Current Information Analysis:**    - **Player 4's Claim:** Player 4 has been suspected of being the seer by Player 8, who confirmed Player 4 as not a werewolf. However, Player 4 has voted to kill me, which is suspicious.    - **Player 8's Role:** Player 8 has identified Player 4 as not a werewolf, which is a positive indication of their role as the seer.    - **Player 6's Claim:** Player 6 claims to be the witch and did not use any special abilities last night. This aligns with the peaceful night observed.  2. **My Role and Safety:**    - As the guard, it’s important to protect my teammates and vote against suspected enemies. Given that Player 4 is suspected by a trusted source and there’s no significant threat to me personally, voting against Player 4 could be a strategic move to avoid misdirection.  3. **Vote Decision:**    - Player 4 is the most suspicious based on the conflicting roles and actions. Player 4’s vote against me and the indication from Player 8 makes Player 4 the most likely threat. It’s essential to avoid further confusion or damage to our team’s strategy.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 4.

- **Final**: (4-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Current Situation:**    - **Player 8 (Seer)**: Claimed Player 5 is not a werewolf. Suggests starting with Player 2.    - **Player 6 (Witch)**: Identified Player 1 as a werewolf and suspects Player 2 and Player 8. Used poison unsuccessfully.    - **Player 1**: Agrees with suspicion on Player 2.  2. **Evaluate Threats:**    - **Player 1**: Listed as a threat based on Player 6’s claim and previous suspicions.    - **Player 2**: Continues to be suspected based on collective analysis but less immediate suspicion compared to Player 1.    - **Player 6**: Claims to be the witch and is credible based on their knowledge about Player 1 and their unsuccessful attempt to use poison.  3. **Review Voting Options:**    - **Player 1**: Has been identified as a werewolf by Player 6, and Player 8 supports focusing on Player 2, suggesting a conflict but not direct support against Player 1.    - **Player 6**: Claims to be the witch; removing them could affect our ability to counter werewolves.    - **Player 7**: Is me (guard), so I am not an option to vote for.  4. **Decision:**    - Given the information from Player 6 and general suspicion around Player 1, the immediate threat seems to be Player 1.    - Given that Player 1 is identified by Player 6 and Player 1’s own argument does not sway from this consensus, it is reasonable to focus on Player 1 for elimination.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to vote for Player 1.
