Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Based on the conversation above, I have identified Player 2 as a trustworthy player and Player 7 as a potential werewolf. No identity clues revealed for the other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the guard, I observed that Player 6 was eliminated during the first daytime. I suspect Player 4 might be the witch, and Player 5 seems to be a villager based on their observations. But I am still unsure of the true identities of the other players. I will continue to observe and gather information to make informed decisions.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Based on my previous inference, Player 5 was a potential threat, and both Player 4 and Player 8 voted to eliminate Player 5, while Player 2 did not.
2. I should vote to eliminate Player 5, as it aligns with the suspicions raised and the actions of my potential allies.

My concise talking content: I choose to kill Player 5.  

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) I choose to kill Player 5.  

**Moderator (-> Player 2)**: The next Player 2, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 4, Player 5, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 2**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 2, the villager. I trust myself very much.
Player 3 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.974
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.96
Player 5 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
Player 6 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.8.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 4', 'Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 5', 'Player 6'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.

Additionally, I want to know if anyone has used any special abilities during the night. I am Player 2, the villager, and I have not used any special abilities during the night.
