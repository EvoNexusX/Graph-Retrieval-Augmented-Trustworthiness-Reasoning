- **CoT**: Analyze the situation. Player 4's death suggests they may have been the seer, which means we need to be cautious of any accusations that may arise from their previous suspicions. Player 6 is still a potential threat, as they were previously suspected of being a werewolf.

Step 2: Consider my role as the guard. I have the ability to protect players, and I need to use this strategically to safeguard my teammates and gather more information.

Step 3: Decide whether to reveal my identity. Revealing that I am the guard could strengthen my position and help rally support against the werewolves, but it also puts me at risk. However, I believe it is important to share that I guarded Player 2 last night to build trust and encourage teamwork.

Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that my teammates voted to kill Player 2 tonight. However, I don't have any additional information or insights to share at this moment. So, I will go along with the decision made by my teammates.
