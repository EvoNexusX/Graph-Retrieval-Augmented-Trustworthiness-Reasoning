I wonder if there is a clear consensus among the players regarding who the werewolf might be? Are there any specific actions or behaviors that have led the players to suspect certain individuals?

However, I need to be cautious and not reveal my role too early in the game.

My reflection in heart (not happened): As the witch, I observed that Player 1 has been suspected by multiple players and has implied the role of seer. However, I cannot determine who is most likely to be a werewolf based on the current information. I should continue to gather more information and be cautious not to reveal my own role.

Player 1 claimed to be the seer and provided information about Player 5 and Player 8. Suspicion has been raised towards Player 8 as a possible werewolf.
What actions have the other players taken during the nighttime phase, and how might this affect the current state of the game?

- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: I am a villager, and based on the information provided by Player 1 before their elimination, I think we should consider the possibility that Player 5 and Player 8 are both cautious villagers. It's important for us to work together to identify the true wolves and protect the villagers.

My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that Player 1 and Player 8 might be the other werewolves. I think that Player 1 might be the seer and Player 8 might be the witch. But I am Player 5, and I am the werewolf. So, I need to continue observing and reasoning about the other players' roles without drawing attention to myself. I should not reveal my role at this point and continue to subtly influence the group's decision to align with my teammates' at night and avoid suspicion during the daytime discussions.
