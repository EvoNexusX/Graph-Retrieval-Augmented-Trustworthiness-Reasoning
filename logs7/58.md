2. Player 3, who was the seer, has been killed. This means the seer will no longer be able to verify the identities of other players.
3. It's important to continue observing the interactions of the other players and gather more information before making any decisions about revealing my identity.

1. **Role Understanding**: As a werewolf, my primary goal is to protect my identity and align with my werewolf teammates (Player 6 and Player 7) to eliminate the villagers and other non-werewolves.

2. **Player Analysis**:
   - **Player 1**: I have already tried to kill Player 1, who I suspect might be a threat, potentially the seer. However, my attempt failed, indicating they might have some protection or intervention.
   - **Player 4**: They are a significant threat due to their high threat level (0.9). Player 4 needs to be carefully monitored.
   - **Player 8**: Previously a threat but eliminated. 
   - **Players 2 and 3**: Both are perceived as good, but they are still threats since they could reveal crucial information or be important in forming alliances against werewolves.
   - **Player 6 and Player 7**: My teammates, so their safety and alignment are crucial.

3. **Daytime Strategy**:
   - **Deflect Suspicion**: I need to act as a villager and avoid revealing my true identity.
   - **Create Confusion**: Sow doubt among the villagers to make it harder for them to identify us.
   - **Coordinate with Teammates**: Align with my werewolf teammates to ensure we target the right player.
