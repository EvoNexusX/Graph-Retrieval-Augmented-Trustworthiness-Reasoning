The suspicion level of the other players towards me is uncertain as I have been cautious in my statements to avoid revealing my role. The potential reveal of the seer's identity is based on the observation that Player 5 has been accused by multiple players and may be the seer.
Can we trust Player 6's claim as the witch? What evidence do we have to support their claim? As the werewolf, I observed that Player 6 claimed to be the witch and expressed trust in Player 1. Based on this information, I will subtly support Player 5's accusation to create suspicion and confusion among the villagers.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 6 has clearly implied their role as the witch by claiming to be the witch and mentioning their suspicions and actions. Player 8 has clearly implied their role as the guard by mentioning their protection of Player 6. No identity clues revealed for Player 7 and Player 4.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 6 has claimed to be the witch and expressed trust in Player 1. I think that we should continue to subtly support the suspicion against Player 2 and Player 3 to create confusion among the villagers. But I am not ready to reveal my identity, so I will continue to be cautious in my statements and actions.  
- **Inference**: Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9.
Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9.
Player 1 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9.
Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9.

1. I need to continue to be cautious and not reveal my true identity as a werewolf.
