- **Final**: (3-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Previous Actions:**    - **Player 4** was voted out and was suspected of being a werewolf. However, Player 4’s role was unclear since they claimed to be the seer.     - **Player 7** was initially against Player 4 but did not provide much additional information or suspicion in the last round.   2. **Evaluate Player Actions and Suspicion:**    - **Player 1** and **Player 8** were key players in voting against Player 4, showing a strong consensus.    - **Player 7** initially voted against Player 4, which could be a tactic to appear non-threatening or to eliminate a competitor.  3. **Current Night Strategy:**    - Without clear evidence on who is definitively a werewolf, it's critical to be cautious with using the poison.    - Since Player 4 is gone, the focus should shift to understanding Player 7, Player 1, and Player 8’s behaviors.  4. **Decision:**    - **Player 7** is a suspect for potentially being a werewolf, as their initial vote was against Player 4, and they have not been transparent about their role or motivations.    - **Player 5** has been relatively quiet, and there's less information about their role or behavior.   **My concise talking content:** I choose to poison Player 7.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: The sun rose. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 5 died last night!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 8, you please.
  
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.

Player 7 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.


['Player 3']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 1'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.

- **Final**: (3-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> Player 1)**: The next Player 1, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 3, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 1**:  
- **Inference**: Player 3 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3.
Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.4 and his level of threat to me is 0.6.  
- **Final**: (3-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Identify Suspicious Behavior:** Player 8 has indicated suspicion towards Player 7 and is now voting to kill Player 3. Player 3 claims to be the witch, which is important if true. However, Player 3’s claim has not been backed up by any observable actions such as using poison or antidote.  2. **Role Analysis:**    - **Player 8’s Role:** Player 8 claims to be a villager. If Player 8 is indeed a villager, their suspicion could be legitimate.     - **Player 3’s Role:** Player 3’s claim to be the witch could be valid, and removing them without confirming their role could be detrimental. If Player 3 is a witch, their ability to counter werewolves is critical.    - **Player 7:** While Player 8 is suspicious of Player 7, Player 7 has not been directly implicated by others yet.  3. **Gather More Evidence:** Since Player 3 has not demonstrated their role’s capability, it’s essential to be cautious about voting them out without further verification.  4. **Strategic Considerations:** I must protect valuable roles and avoid making a hasty decision that could undermine our faction’s chances. Given the current state, protecting Player 3 (if they are the witch) might be more beneficial.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose to vote to kill Player 8 based on the current voting pattern and lack of substantial evidence against Player 3. Further observation and verification are needed before making any drastic decisions about Player 3’s role.   **My final decision:** I vote to kill Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> Player 3)**: The next Player 3, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 3, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 3**:

Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.213 and his level of threat to me is 0.787.  
- **Final**: (3-th daytime) I choose to vote to kill Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 8 will be killed! You can make a brief last statement.
