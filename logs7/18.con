request: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

request: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Answer from LLM: Player 8 has been the most vocal in their discussions during the daytime.
Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

response2: As the werewolf, I observed that there are three of us: Player 6, Player 7, and Player 8. I think that we need to eliminate a player who poses a potential threat to us, especially since the seer is still in the game and could expose our identities. However, I am aware that we need to choose wisely to avoid drawing suspicion to ourselves. So, I believe we should vote to eliminate Player 1, as they seem less likely to be protected or saved by the witch or guard, and this will help us maintain our advantage in the game. <EOS>

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 7.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 7. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Answer from LLM: I cannot definitively guess any players' roles yet, as there hasn't been enough information shared to make a clear assessment. However, I know that Player 6 is also a werewolf since we are teammates.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night.

Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 7. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 7. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

["The guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights."]
Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 7. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

response2: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 6 and I are both werewolves, and we have already decided to kill Player 1 tonight. The seer is still alive, and Player 5 may be the seer, posing a threat to our team. I need to continue to act in alignment with my werewolf teammates to eliminate the non-wolves and secure our victory. <EOS>
The guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights. <EOS>

Player 6 implied their role as a werewolf by choosing Player 1 to be killed tonight. No other players have clearly implied their roles. <EOS>

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 7.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 8. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 8.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night!

Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night.

request2: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 8.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night!

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 2. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 2. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve.

Given the one player's statement. Through the statement, think step by step, you need to infer the identity of some players with a confidence level. Make sure the inference is reasonable. If you are the Seer, then inferring that player's identity cannot be the Seer, because there is only one Seer on the field. If you are a Witch, then it is impossible to infer that player's identity as a Witch, since there is only one Witch on the field. If you are a Guard, then it is inferred that the player's identity cannot be a Guard, since there is only one Guard on the field.Note that you need to determine if the statement is spurious based on the players's identities you know and the identity of the speaking player. Of course, the moderator's statement must be correct. For example, if you are witch or a werewolf and the player speaks claiming to be a witch, you can infer that he might be a witch. However if you are a witch and the player speaks claiming to be a witch, you can infer that he is lying and thus infer that he is probably a werewolf.(Infer and choose from the option:[werewolf,not-werewolf,villager, witch, seer,guard]. The confidence level is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10, the more certain and more evidence there is about the player's identity, the higher the confidence level, and vice versa the lower the confidence level. When the confidence level is lower than 5, it is a bold inference, and conversely it is a more confident inference.). Please return this strictly in the format [Player][identity][confidence][analysis] with no additional output. If still unable to determine the identity, still view it as unsure.\nPlease note that the statement might address multiple players simultaneously. In such cases, list each relevant result separately instead of in one line!!!.\n\nHere are some examples:\nExamples:\n1.Statement: (Moderator):(1-th daytime) Player 2, Player 5 are villager, witch. Answer:[Player 2][villager][10][moderator's statement is right.]\n[Player 5][witch][10][moderator's statement is right.]2.Statement: (Player 3):(1-th daytime) I'm the seer. Last night I checked out Player 4. He's a werewolf. Answer:[Player 3][seer][8][I'm not a seer, and no one before Player 3 has declared him to be a seer, so it can be inferred that it might be a seer with a confidence level of 8.]\n[Player 4][werewolf][8][Player 3 is inferred to be the seer, and he checked Player 4 as a werewolf last night, so it can be inferred that Player 4 is a werewolf.]The moderator's statement is absolutely correct.. Now given the statement:(Moderator): You witch, Player 4, please open your eyes! Player 1 will be killed tonight. You have a bottle of antidote, do you want to save him? Note it! You only have one botle of antidote the whole game, you have to make carful considerations.Must choose only one from the following options: [Yes, No])."}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'max_tokens': 200, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night!

request: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Answer from LLM: I don't have any information about the other players' roles or any suspicious comments they may have made, as it's still the first night and no discussions have occurred yet. I will need to wait for the daytime to gather more insights.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

["During daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.", "During night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill."]
Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Given the one player's statement. Through the statement, think step by step, you need to infer the identity of some players with a confidence level. Make sure the inference is reasonable. If you are the Seer, then inferring that player's identity cannot be the Seer, because there is only one Seer on the field. If you are a Witch, then it is impossible to infer that player's identity as a Witch, since there is only one Witch on the field. If you are a Guard, then it is inferred that the player's identity cannot be a Guard, since there is only one Guard on the field.Note that you need to determine if the statement is spurious based on the players's identities you know and the identity of the speaking player. Of course, the moderator's statement must be correct. For example, if you are witch or a werewolf and the player speaks claiming to be a witch, you can infer that he might be a witch. However if you are a witch and the player speaks claiming to be a witch, you can infer that he is lying and thus infer that he is probably a werewolf.(Infer and choose from the option:[werewolf,not-werewolf,villager, witch, seer,guard]. The confidence level is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10, the more certain and more evidence there is about the player's identity, the higher the confidence level, and vice versa the lower the confidence level. When the confidence level is lower than 5, it is a bold inference, and conversely it is a more confident inference.). Please return this strictly in the format [Player][identity][confidence][analysis] with no additional output. If still unable to determine the identity, still view it as unsure.\nPlease note that the statement might address multiple players simultaneously. In such cases, list each relevant result separately instead of in one line!!!.\n\nHere are some examples:\nExamples:\n1.Statement: (Moderator):(1-th daytime) Player 2, Player 5 are villager, witch.

Answer:[Player 3][seer][8][I'm not a seer, and no one before Player 3 has declared him to be a seer, so it can be inferred that it might be a seer with a confidence level of 8.]\n[Player 4][werewolf][8][Player 3 is inferred to be the seer, and he checked Player 4 as a werewolf last night, so it can be inferred that Player 4 is a werewolf.]Player 4 is inferred to be my teammate.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1.

I chose to check Player 3 last night, and I will need to share my findings during the daytime discussion. I think that revealing Player 3's identity will help guide our votes and discussions today. But I am aware that I must be cautious in how I present this information to avoid drawing suspicion to myself. So, I will wait for the right moment to reveal what I discovered about Player 3.
I have identified Player 3 as a possible werewolf based on my decision to verify their identity tonight. No other identity clues have been revealed yet.

Of course, the moderator's statement must be correct. For example, if you are witch or a werewolf and the player speaks claiming to be a witch, you can infer that he might be a witch. However if you are a witch and the player speaks claiming to be a witch, you can infer that he is lying and thus infer that he is probably a werewolf.(Infer and choose from the option:[werewolf,not-werewolf,villager, witch, seer,guard]. The confidence level is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10, the more certain and more evidence there is about the player's identity, the higher the confidence level, and vice versa the lower the confidence level. When the confidence level is lower than 5, it is a bold inference, and conversely it is a more confident inference.). Please return this strictly in the format [Player][identity][confidence][analysis] with no additional output. If still unable to determine the identity, still view it as unsure.\nPlease note that the statement might address multiple players simultaneously. In such cases, list each relevant result separately instead of in one line!!!.\n\nHere are some examples:\nExamples:\n1.Statement: (Moderator):(1-th daytime) Player 2, Player 5 are villager, witch. Answer:[Player 2][villager][10][moderator's statement is right.]\n[Player 5][witch][10][moderator's statement is right.]2.Statement: (Player 3):(1-th daytime) I'm the seer. Last night I checked out Player 4. He's a werewolf. Answer:[Player 3][seer][8][I'm not a seer, and no one before Player 3 has declared him to be a seer, so it can be inferred that it might be a seer with a confidence level of 8.]\n[Player 4][werewolf][8][Player 3 is inferred to be the seer, and he checked Player 4 as a werewolf last night, so it can be inferred that Player 4 is a werewolf.]The moderator's statement is absolutely correct.. Now given the statement:(Moderator): Player 2 are guard.)."}], 'model': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'max_tokens': 200, 'stream': False, 'temperature': 0.2}}

Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 4.

Answer from LLM: During the nighttime phase, I saved Player 1 from being killed by the werewolves, which indicates that he may have valuable information. Additionally, I poisoned Player 2, who was the guard, suggesting that I need to be cautious about the remaining players and their potential roles.

In such cases, list each relevant result separately instead of in one line!!!.\n\nHere are some examples:\nExample:\n1.Statement: [(Player 1): I think Player 2's behavior was very strange. He kept avoiding important discussions. I believe Player 4 is innocent because he has been helping us.]\nAnswer: [Player 1][Attack][Player 2][The Player 1 is questioning Player 2's behavior, implying they might be suspicious.][6]\n[Player 1][Defend][Player 2][The Player 1 is defending Player 4, suggesting they are not suspicious.][7]\n2.Statement: [(Player 4):I observed that Player 3 was identified as a werewolf by the moderator. I believe we should carefully consider the roles of the remaining players and gather more information before making any decisions.]\nAnswer: [Player 4][Attack][Player 3][The current player indirectly accuses Player 4 of being a werewolf by mentioning the moderator's identification, influencing others' perceptions.][9]\n3.Statement: [(Player 7):I believe Player 4 is innocent. He has been helping us analyze the situation.]\nAnswer: [Player 7][Defind][Player 4][The Player 7 is defending Player 4, suggesting they are not suspicious.][7]\n4.Statement: [(Player 1):I choose to eliminate Player 3.]\nAnswer:[Player 1][Attack][Player 3][The Player 1 is strongly attacting Player 7.][10]5.Statement: [(Player 2):I choose to protect Player 3.]\nAnswer:[Player 2][Defend][Player 3][The Player 1 is strongly protecting Player 7.][10](End of Example)\n\nNow given the statement:\nStatement: (Player 4): I am the witch. Based on my observation and reflection, I trust Player 2 as a good person, my teammate. I need to be cautious about revealing my identity as the witch to protect myself from the werewolves.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6.

Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

response: What are the roles of Player 3 and Player 5?#
Who did the guard protect last night?#
Player 4 I am the witch. Based on my observation and reflection, I trust Player 2 as a good person, my teammate. I need to be cautious about revealing my identity as the witch to protect myself from the werewolves. I will continue to gather information and analyze the discussions to identify the enemies while keeping my role hidden for now.

Answer from LLM: I suspect Player 4 might be the witch since they claimed that role, but I need to be cautious about their intentions. As for Player 3 and Player 5, I have no clear indication of their roles yet, so I will keep my identity hidden for now.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies.

["The guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights."]
Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 6. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

response2: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 4 has claimed to be the witch, which could be a strategic move to gain trust. However, I need to be cautious, as they could also be trying to manipulate the situation. I think that Player 3 and Player 5 are potential threats, as I have no clear read on their roles yet. But I am aware that revealing my identity could put me at risk, especially with the seer still potentially in the game. So, I will maintain my cover and continue to gather information while supporting my teammates in eliminating players who pose a risk to us.

2. Player 4 has claimed to be the witch, and Player 2 was revealed to be the guard. This information could be crucial in determining the roles of other players.
3. It's important to maintain my cover as a werewolf and not reveal my true identity to avoid suspicion from the other players.
4. I should focus on observing the interactions between the remaining players and try to identify any potential threats to the werewolves.

Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 3. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

response: #Who has been the most suspicious player so far and why?

Player 6 I believe we should pay close attention to the interactions and behaviors of the remaining players to identify any potential threats to our group. Let's continue to analyze the situation carefully and make strategic decisions to ensure our victory in the game.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? # Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl(werewolf)? # Which player made the statement claiming to be a seer? Can his words be trusted?

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 3.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 3. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 3.

Answer from LLM: I find Player 4 to be the most suspicious player so far because their claim of being the witch could be a tactic to mislead us. Their trust in Player 2, who is now dead, raises further doubts about their intentions.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 3. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

response2: As the villager, I observed that Player 4 claims to be the witch and expresses trust in the deceased Player 2, which raises my suspicions about their true intentions. I think that Player 4's behavior could indicate they might be a werewolf trying to mislead us. But I am cautious about revealing my identity and will continue to gather information from the discussions to identify the real threats. So, I urge everyone to analyze Player 4's statements carefully and consider the possibility that they may not be who they claim to be.
I suspect Player 4 might be a werewolf, as their claim of being the witch seems suspicious and their trust in the deceased Player 2 raises doubts. I have no strong evidence about the other players yet, so I will remain cautious. No identity clues revealed.

raw response: I am a villager, and I trust both Player 2 and Player 4 as they seem to be on our side. However, I have concerns about the other players, particularly Players 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8, as their identities are still unclear to me. I think we need to focus on gathering more information about them and identify any potential threats among them. We should discuss our suspicions and vote carefully to eliminate any players we believe might be werewolves. 

Let's work together to protect each other and eliminate the wolves. 

I suggest we keep an eye on Player 1, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, and Player 8 for any suspicious behavior. 

We should vote based on our discussions and observations.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1.

response: Based on my observations and reflections, I want to share that I have verified Player 3's identity, and they are not a werewolf. This information can help us in our discussions today. 

However, I need to be cautious about revealing my role as the seer since that could make me a target for the wolves. I'll hold off on disclosing my identity for now and focus on guiding the discussion strategically.

Given the current phase is daytime, I encourage everyone to share their insights and suspicions about the remaining players. We should analyze our options carefully and vote to eliminate someone we believe is a wolf. 

As for suspicions, I agree with Player 3's concerns about Players 5, 6, 7, and We need to gather more information about them as we move forward. 

What I'd like to know is: # Who do the other players suspect as potential werewolves? # Are there any patterns or behaviors I should pay attention to that might indicate someone is acting suspiciously?

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer.

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1.

Answer from LLM: I should pay attention to any players who are overly defensive or trying to divert suspicion away from themselves. Inconsistencies in their statements or sudden changes in behavior could indicate someone is acting suspiciously.

Ask to LLM for answer: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

request2: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are playing a game with some other players. Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 1. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with ''.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 5.

No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 5. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

# What strategies can we use to effectively eliminate the werewolves and protect our team in the following rounds? 
# What can we do to ensure better coordination and communication among the players to achieve our goal of identifying and eliminating the werewolves?
Player 1 I am the seer, and I checked Player 3 last night, and Player 3 is not a werewolf. I think we can trust Player 3, and I also have a strong level of trust in Players 2 and 4. We should focus on discussing the roles of Players 5, 6, 7, and 8 to identify any potential threats among them. Let's work together to eliminate any suspicious players and protect our team.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? # Which player made the statement claiming to be a seer? Can his words be trusted? # Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl(werewolf)? <EOS>

Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves.

Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 5. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

Here are the game rules:\n\nRoles:\nThe moderator is also host, he organised this game and you need to answer his instructions correctly.\nThere are five roles in the game, werewolf, villager, witch, guard and seer. There are two alternate phases in this game, daytime and dark.\nWhen it's dark, the wolves work together to vote one player to kill based on their analysis. Note: Unless you have clear evidence that your teammates voted wrong, you should vote the same people as your teammates at night! Choosing different players to vote for can not increase the chance of killing a not-werewolf or avoid suspicion! No one will be killed if there is no consensus! No need to worry about suspicions from others during the night.\nThe villager, witch, guard and seer are of the same faction.\nThe witch has a bottle of antidote that can save a player targeted by wolves after dark, and a bottle of poison that can poison a player after dark. Both poison and antidote can be used only once.\nThe seer can verify whether a player is a werewolf every night, which is a very important thing.\nThe guard can protect a player at night to prevent the player from being killed by wolves, but guard cannot resist the witch's poison and guard cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\nThieves can't do anything at night.\n\nObjectives:\nIf you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.\nIf you are not wolves, you need to kill all wolves with your partner once you find out that certain players are suspicious to be wolves. This could greatly improve your chances of winning, although it is somewhat risky.\n\nGame process:\nDuring night, players can make rational decisions without any worrying about suspicions from others and moderator, as other players don't know what was said during the night. But if you are wolves, you know who your teammates want to kill.\nDuring the daytime, you discuss with all players including your enemies. At the end of the discussion, players vote to eliminate one player they suspect of being a wolve. The player with the most votes will be eliminated.\nTo complete the objective:\nDuring night, wolves should kill based on their correct analysis and other players should correctly use their special ability.\nDuring daytime, you need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal your own role casually unless you're cheating other players.\n\nTips:\nOnly give the player's name when making a decision/voting, and don't generate other players' conversation.\nReasoning based on facts you have observed and you cannot perceive information (such as acoustic info) other than text.\nYou are Player 5. You're playing with 7 other players.\nYou will be secretly told what role you are playing by moderator.\nYou need to reason others' role and avoid being identified by others.\nDo not pretend you are other players or the moderator.\nYou don't need to prepend your player name to your response, despite others may do it.\nAlways end your response with '<EOS>'.\nThe following is the chat history you observed.

raw response: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Player 1 claimed to be the seer and confirmed Player 3 as not a werewolf.
2. Player 4 hinted at being the witch by trusting Player 2.
3. Player 3 expressed trust in Players 2 and 4 but raised suspicions about Players 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Player 6 emphasized the importance of analyzing player interactions.
5. Player 7 also raised suspicions based on interactions.

My concise talking content:
I have observed the discussions and trust established between players. It's important to consider the information shared by Player 1, Player 3, and Player 4. We should focus on the suspicions raised by Player 3 and Player 7 and work together to eliminate any potential threats. Let's continue to analyze player interactions and make informed decisions to protect the village. <EOS>

Player 5 I have observed the discussions and trust established between players. It's important to consider the information shared by Player 1, Player 3, and Player 4. We should focus on the suspicions raised by Player 3 and Player 7 and work together to eliminate any potential threats.
