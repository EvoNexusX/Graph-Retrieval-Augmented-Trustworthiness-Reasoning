**Player 7**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 7, the guard. I trust myself very much.


['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 4', 'Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 8']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (1-th night) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Understanding My Role:**    - I am the Guard, and my role is to protect a player from werewolf attacks. I cannot protect the same player on consecutive nights.  2. **Evaluating Options:**    - Since it’s the first night, I don’t have any specific information about who might be targeted or who might be a werewolf.    - I need to make a decision based on the general importance of protecting players who are likely to be targeted due to their roles or potential information value.  3. **Deciding on Protection:**    - **Player 1**: I chose Player 1 for protection as a precaution. Without any specific information on other players' roles, it is reasonable to start by protecting a player to ensure their safety and potentially gather more information about their role in future nights.  4. **Future Considerations:**    - In subsequent nights, I should be attentive to the daytime discussions to gather more information on who might be werewolves and adjust my protection strategy accordingly.  ### Concise Talking Content: I choose to protect Player 1 tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 4'])**: You choiced to kill the Player 1.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 8'])**: You witch, Player 8, please open your eyes! You have a bottle of poison, who are you going to kill tonight? Note it! You only have one botle of poison the whole game, you have to make carful considerations.Choose one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the witch. I trust myself very much.


['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 4', 'Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 7']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (1-th night) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Role Analysis**:    - As the witch, I have two tools: poison and antidote.    - I need to use poison to eliminate a werewolf or a potential threat.    - I can only use poison once, so it must be used wisely.  2. **Lack of Information**:    - This is the first night, and no information has been shared yet.    - I don't have any knowledge about other players' roles at this point.  3. **Initial Decision**:    - Given that there is no specific information, I must make a decision based on intuition or randomly.  4. **Strategy**:    - Since it's the first night and I have no evidence, choosing a player to poison might be purely speculative.    - If I want to increase my chances of hitting a werewolf, I could consider selecting a player whose behavior or interaction might be suspicious in future discussions.  5. **Current Choice**:    - Without any specific clues, I will make a random choice. I need to avoid choosing myself and be ready to act strategically based on future information.  ### Concise Talking Content:  I choose to poison Player 1.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 6'])**: You seer, Player 6, please open your eyes! Who are you going to verify its identity tonight? Choose only one from the following living options: [Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessment of Information:**    - **Player 2**: Confirmed as a werewolf by Player 6, who is the seer, and Player 8, who claims to be the witch and has used poison on Player 2.    - **Player 4**: Exhibits suspicious behavior as noted by Player 3 and seems to be defending against suspicion, which might indicate they are a werewolf. However, their direct threat level is lower than Player 2’s confirmed status.    - **Player 5, 6, 8**: All seem to be working towards the common goal of eliminating werewolves and are credible based on their claims.  2. **Strategic Decision:**    - Given the information that Player 2 is confirmed as a werewolf and there is a strong consensus among Players 6 and 8 regarding their identity, voting to eliminate Player 2 is the most logical step to protect the village and ensure the werewolves are reduced.    - Player 4 is a potential threat but addressing Player 2, a confirmed werewolf, should take precedence.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 2.

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Evaluate the Information:**    - **Player 2:** Confirmed as a werewolf by Player 6 (the seer). Player 8, who claims to be the witch, has poisoned Player 2.    - **Player 4:** Exhibits suspicious behavior; could be a werewolf or attempting to protect one.    - **Player 6:** Identified as the seer, who has confirmed Player 2's werewolf status. Therefore, Player 6 is trustworthy.    - **Player 8:** Claims to be the witch and has used poison on Player 2, which aligns with the seer's information.  2. **Assessing the Threat Levels:**    - Player 2: Clearly identified as a werewolf, so they are a high priority for elimination.    - Player 4: Suspicious but not yet confirmed; need further observation.    - Player 6: Trusted based on their role as the seer.    - Player 8: Trusted based on their role as the witch and their actions aligning with the seer's information.  3. **Decide on the Immediate Action:**    - Since Player 2 is confirmed as a werewolf and Player 8 has poisoned them, the priority should be to confirm their elimination. Voting to kill Player 2 ensures that a known threat is removed from the game.  ### Concise Talking Content: I choose to vote to kill Player 2.

Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 5'] are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Evaluate the Situation:**    - Player 2 has been confirmed as a werewolf by both Player 6 (the seer) and Player 8 (the witch who used poison on Player 2).    - Player 4 is exhibiting suspicious behavior and trying to divert attention away from themselves, but Player 2's confirmed werewolf status should be prioritized.  2. **Assess Player 2’s Situation:**    - Player 2 is confirmed as a werewolf through multiple sources: the seer's vision and the witch’s poison.    - Player 4 is a potential werewolf, but Player 2 is an immediate and confirmed threat.  3. **Decide on the Action:**    - Given that Player 2 is a confirmed werewolf and the group consensus, the immediate action should be to vote out Player 2.

- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Assessment of Information:**    - **Player 6**: Identified as the seer and confirmed Player 2 as a werewolf. Their survival is crucial for the continuation of the game, as their insights are valuable.    - **Player 4**: Exhibited suspicious behavior and was a target for Player 2's last-minute accusations. Although Player 4 is a potential threat, Player 6's protection is more urgent at this moment.    - **Player 8**: Claims to be the witch and has poisoned Player 2. They are a trustworthy ally and should not be prioritized for protection over Player 6.    - **Player 3**: While not explicitly stated, Player 3 seems to be on the side of the villagers based on their voting pattern.  2. **Prioritization:**    - **Protect Player 6**: Given that Player 6 is confirmed as the seer and their role is vital for identifying werewolves, protecting them takes precedence over other potential threats. Player 6's safety will ensure we have accurate information for the next day.  3. **Decision:**    - I will choose to protect Player 6 tonight to safeguard our key ally and maintain our strategic advantage.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to protect Player 6 tonight.

This makes it crucial to verify Player 4's status to maintain our strategy and avoid confusion.  2. **Priority of Verification:**    - I need to verify Player 4’s identity because Player 4’s suspicious behavior and the fact that Player 2's accusations were directed at them make Player 4 a high priority.    - Player 4's potential werewolf status is crucial information that will help in strategizing the next steps and verifying if Player 4 is indeed a threat or not.  3. **Verification Decision:**    - I will verify Player 4 to either confirm or refute the suspicion about them being a werewolf.

This suggests that Player 4 is not currently in danger from my poison.    - Since my poison was ineffective, I should not use my antidote or poison on Player 4 at this time.    - The safest course of action is to follow the consensus and vote to eliminate Player 4, who is confirmed to be a werewolf.  3. **Strategic Voting:**    - Given the evidence and the consensus among the other players, voting to eliminate Player 4 aligns with the goal of removing a werewolf from the game.  **My concise talking content:**  I vote to kill Player 4.
