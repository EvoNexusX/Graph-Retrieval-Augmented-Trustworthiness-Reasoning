<EOS>  
- **Final**: (2-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Observation of the Current Situation:**    - Player 6 (the witch) attempted to poison me but failed. This suggests that the witch is still active and trying to influence the game against the werewolves.    - Player 8 (the guard) claimed to protect Player 6, and Player 5 (a villager) supported Player 8's claim.    - Given the current votes, Player 4 (myself) and Player 6 are the targets. The goal is to decide which player will be more detrimental to eliminate or protect based on the current phase.  2. **Evaluation of Threats:**    - If Player 6 is left alive, they can potentially use their poison against a key player in the next round.    - Player 8 and Player 5 are working together against the werewolves, while Player 3 is neutral at this point and has not been directly accused.  3. **Decision Making:**    - Given that Player 6 is the witch and can still pose a significant threat with their poison, it is crucial to eliminate them to prevent further attempts to sabotage the werewolves' plans.    - Player 4 (myself) being targeted now could reveal my role if I am not cautious.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 6.

- **Final**: (4-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Reflect on Current Information:**    - Player 6, who I suspected might be the witch, was killed last night, indicating the werewolves saw them as a threat.     - Player 5 has supported my claim of being the guard and hasn’t shown suspicious behavior. I trust Player 5.    - Player 3’s actions and statements have raised red flags, making me cautious of them being a werewolf.   2. **Analyze the Situation:**    - We have eliminated Player 4, a confirmed werewolf.    - Player 3’s inconsistencies suggest they might be a werewolf. Player 5, on the other hand, seems trustworthy and has been supportive of my role as the guard.  3. **Decide on Voting Strategy:**    - To ensure that the team is working towards eliminating werewolves, Player 3 is the primary suspect based on their behavior.    - Since Player 5 is trusted and has been supportive, there is no reason to vote against them.  ### Concise Talking Content: **I vote to kill Player 3.**
