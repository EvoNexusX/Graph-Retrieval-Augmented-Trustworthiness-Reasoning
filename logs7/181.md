Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? My reflection in heart (not happened): Based on the information provided, the seer is likely still alive. The most threatening player who could potentially be the seer is Player 8, as they claimed to have checked Player 3 and confirmed them as a werewolf.

Player 3's final statement before being eliminated may indicate that there is more to the situation than meets the eye, and I should consider this carefully in my strategy moving forward.

My final objective in this game is to cooperate with my teammates to eliminate all players who are not wolves. Based on the chat history, Player 8 might be the seer, and Player 5 might be the witch.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that Player 8 claimed to be the seer and checked Player 4, confirming them as a werewolf. I think that we should continue to gather information and be cautious of the seer's findings. But I am not revealing my own role at this point, so I need to be careful with my words and actions.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? During daytime, I need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal my own role casually unless I'm cheating other players.

I think that we should continue to gather information and be cautious of the seer's findings. But I am not revealing my own role at this point.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? During daytime, I need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be careful not to reveal my own role casually unless I'm cheating other players.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? I vote to kill Player 7.
What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game?
Can my teammates confirm their roles and provide any additional information to support our decisions?
Is the seer alive and if so, which player do we suspect to be the seer?
Is there any player that seems suspicious or has been acting in a way that is inconsistent with their claimed role?
What actions can we take during the daytime to gather more information and make informed decisions? My player name is Player 1 and my role is the werewolf. My final objective in this game is to work with my teammates to eliminate all players who are not wolves.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 6 implied the role of guard by claiming to have protected Player 8. Player 7 claimed to be a villager. Player 8 claimed to be the seer and verified Player 7 as not a werewolf.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 8 claimed to be the seer and verified Player 7 as not a werewolf. I think that we should continue to gather information and be cautious of the seer's findings. But I am not revealing my own role at this point. So, I will continue to play along and support the suspicions towards Player 7 and Player 6 to divert attention from myself.  
- **Inference**: Player 1 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2.
Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.1.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. I need to continue playing along and supporting the suspicions towards Player 7 and Player 6 to divert attention from myself.
2. Revealing my identity as the werewolf at this point would be too risky, as it would make me an immediate target for elimination.
3. I should try to blend in with the other players and act as if I am also suspicious of Player 7 and Player 6.

My concise talking content:
"I agree with the suspicions towards Player 7 and Player 6. Their behavior has been quite suspicious, and I think we should focus our attention on them for now."  

- **Final**: I agree with the suspicions towards Player 7 and Player 6. Their behavior has been quite suspicious, and I think we should focus our attention on them for now.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Now you Player 6 are asked to choose which of the players should be voted for killing based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 6**:
