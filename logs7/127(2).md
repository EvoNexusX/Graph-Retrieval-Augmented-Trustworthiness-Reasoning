(You can't protect the same one from the last night).You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 6**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 6, the guard. I trust myself very much.


['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 4', 'Player 5', 'Player 7', 'Player 8']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. None are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (1-th night) My step-by-step thought process: 1. **Assess the Situation:** It's the first night, so I have no direct information about who might be a werewolf or who to trust. The only information available is that I'm the guard, and I need to choose someone to protect. 2. **Choose a Target:** Since it's the first night, it's prudent to protect someone who might be a potential target for the werewolves. Without any prior information, choosing a player at random is as reasonable as any other approach. 3. **Avoid Revealing My Role:** Protecting myself is an option, but it’s better to protect someone else to avoid revealing my role too early. If I protect myself, it could be perceived as suspicious or reveal my role. 4. **Make a Decision:** Given that I don’t have information on who might be targeted, I’ll choose a player to protect based on no specific criteria.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 1 to protect tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 1', 'Player 3', 'Player 4'])**: You choiced to kill the Player 2.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 7'])**: You witch, Player 7, please open your eyes! Player 2 will be killed tonight. You have a bottle of antidote, do you want to save him? Note it!

- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Consider Seer’s Claim:** Player 8, the seer, has identified Player 4 as a werewolf. Given the seer’s role is crucial, their claim should be taken seriously unless we have clear evidence against them.  2. **Analyze Voting Patterns:**    - Player 2, Player 1, and I have all supported the vote against Player 4.    - Player 3 voted to kill Player 8, which conflicts with the seer’s claim.    - Player 4’s response challenges the seer, which could indicate an attempt to deflect suspicion.  3. **Evaluate Player Behavior:**     - Player 4 is being defensive and critical of the seer’s claim, which aligns with the behavior of a werewolf trying to avoid detection.    - The votes against Player 4 from multiple players, including the seer and other trusted roles, strongly suggest that they are indeed a werewolf.  4. **My Conclusion:**    - Given the high trust in Player 8’s claim and the behavior of Player 4, it is logical to support the vote against Player 4. Eliminating a werewolf now is crucial to improving our chances of winning.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 4.

This behavior is consistent with a werewolf trying to avoid elimination.  3. **Review My Own Observations:**    - As the seer, I identified Player 4 as a werewolf, and the consensus among other players supports this.    - The voting pattern and the defense by Player 4 align with their being a werewolf, and removing them is crucial.  4. **Reinforce Vote Based on Team Consensus:**    - All trusted teammates, including Player 2, Player 5, Player 6, and Player 7, are voting for Player 4.    - It is critical to act in concert with this consensus to ensure the elimination of the identified werewolf.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 4.

Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy.  
- **Final**: (1-th daytime) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Context Analysis:**    - **Player 8** is claiming to be the seer and has identified me as a werewolf. This has led to a consensus against me from several players.    - **Player 3** voted against Player 8 and is not aligned with the majority, making them suspicious.     - **Player 2** and **Player 7** are inferred to be my teammates, while **Player 5** and **Player 6** are not confirmed allies.    - I am currently the primary target, so my objective is to shift suspicion away from myself.  2. **Objective Analysis:**    - **Player 3** is a potential target since their vote against Player 8 might cast doubt on the seer's credibility and redirect suspicion from me.    - **Player 8** is the primary threat since they have identified me as a werewolf and thus need to be discredited or removed.  3. **Vote Decision:**    - Given that Player 3's actions have created suspicion and can potentially help shift focus away from me, it makes sense to vote to kill Player 3 to create confusion and misdirection.    - If Player 3 is eliminated, it might increase the chance of survival for me by diverting attention away from the current consensus against me.  **My concise talking content:** I vote to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 4 will be killed! You can make a brief last statement.

You Player 1 only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 1**:  
- **Inference**: Player 1 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate.  
- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Role and Objective:** As a werewolf, my goal is to eliminate the non-werewolf players, including those with special abilities that could reveal or thwart our plans.  2. **Previous Night Actions:** On the previous night, the focus was on killing Player 8, who is suspected to be the seer. Since the seer can identify werewolves and is a significant threat, eliminating them is a priority.  3. **Current Context:**    - **Player 1:** Me (werewolf), so my role is clear.    - **Player 2:** Previously inferred as a teammate, meaning we have some common goals.    - **Player 3:** Previously inferred as a high threat and likely an enemy, which could indicate a non-werewolf role or another threat.    - **Player 4:** Previously deemed an enemy with a high threat level. If Player 8 is indeed the seer, Player 4 could be an ally or a major threat.    - **Player 5:** Previously inferred as a teammate.    - **Player 6 and Player 7:** No specific information available about their roles yet.  4. **Current Priority:**    - We should continue targeting high-priority threats. Given that Player 8 was identified as a high-priority target and assuming the information about Player 8 being the seer is accurate, Player 8 should still be a key target.    - The objective remains to eliminate Player 8 to reduce the threat from the seer and continue with our strategy.  5. **Decision:** Based on the information, I should continue with the plan to kill Player 8 as they are a significant threat to our role.  **My concise talking content:** I choose Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 1', 'Player 3'])**: The next werewolf, you Player 3, please vote and tell your teammates that which of the players should be killed tonight.

**Player 3**:  
- **Inference**: Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.  
- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Identify the Key Player**: Based on the previous reflection, Player 8 is suspected to be the seer. This is crucial information because the seer has the power to identify werewolves, which poses a significant threat to us.  2. **Evaluate the Current Situation**: Since I am a werewolf, our goal is to eliminate non-werewolves effectively. Player 8 being the seer can expose us, so it is essential to remove them before they can reveal our identities.  3. **Assess the Team's Consensus**: To maintain coordination and avoid suspicion, it’s important that my vote aligns with the strategic objective of the werewolves. My reflection indicates that Player 8 is a target, which aligns with my goal of removing threats.  4. **Decision Making**: Given that Player 8 is likely the seer and a high priority target, I should vote to kill Player 8 to minimize risk and ensure our dominance in the game.  **My concise talking content**: I choose Player 8.
