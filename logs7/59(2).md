- **Final**: (4-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process  1. **Analyze Current Situation:**    - **Player 1**: They were previously targeted for elimination, and you attempted to poison them unsuccessfully. Player 1 has been suspected by others and is currently being voted for elimination.    - **Player 5**: Claims to be the guard and has protected Player 6. Player 5's claim seems credible if they are indeed the guard.    - **Player 7**: Previously identified as a werewolf, which makes them a priority target.    - **Players 2, 3, 4, 6**: These players are not actively discussed or targeted, which implies they might be either neutral or trustworthy.  2. **Consider Your Role and Strategy:**    - As the witch, your goal is to protect your teammates and eliminate enemies. Given that Player 7 is identified as a werewolf, they are the highest priority for elimination.    - Player 1’s elimination might be detrimental as they could be a key ally (villager or seer), but it seems there’s consensus on Player 1 being targeted.  3. **Decision on Voting:**    - Despite the consensus on Player 1, you should prioritize eliminating the identified werewolf, Player 7, to safeguard your team. Eliminating Player 7 will directly benefit your side by removing an enemy threat.  ### Concise Talking Content  I choose to vote to kill Player 7.

- **Final**: (5-th daytime) I choose to kill Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> Player 8)**: The next Player 8, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 8**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 8, the witch. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (5-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 7.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Only the living can be killed, Player 7 is dead, hence no one will be killed!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: It's dark, everyone close your eyes.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 1'])**: Werewolves, please open your eyes! Now vote and tell your teammates which of the players should be killed tonight. You Player 1 only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 8, pass].

- **Final**: (6-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Current Situation:**    - Player 5 (likely the guard) and Player 7 (villager) are dead.    - Player 8 has claimed to be the witch and is pushing for the elimination of Player 7.    - Player 1 (myself) is a werewolf and needs to maintain secrecy while achieving the objective of killing all non-wolves.  2. **Evaluate Current Threats:**    - Player 8 has revealed themselves as the witch and has previously tried to poison Player 7, indicating that they might still be a threat and their removal could benefit the werewolves.    - No other specific threats have been clearly identified, but the witch's presence is a significant concern.  3. **Strategize for the Night:**    - Since Player 8's role as the witch poses a direct threat to werewolves and they are actively targeting potential werewolves or villagers, it is crucial to eliminate them to weaken the opposing faction's ability to protect or harm players.  4. **Decision Making:**    - Considering that Player 8 is the witch and poses an immediate threat with their ability to poison, it is strategically beneficial to eliminate them before they can use their powers against the werewolves.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to kill Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 1'])**: You choiced to kill the Player 8.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 8'])**: You witch, Player 8, please open your eyes! You have a bottle of poison, who are you going to kill tonight? Note it! You only have one botle of poison the whole game, you have to make carful considerations.Choose one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 8, pass].
