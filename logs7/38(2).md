- **Final**: (2-th night) I choose Player 8.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 1'])**: Failed, your poison has run out!  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 3'])**: You seer, Player 3, please open your eyes! Who are you going to verify its identity tonight? Choose only one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 7, pass].   
**Player 3**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the seer. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 4'] are more trustworthy to me. [] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (2-th night) I choose Player 1.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 3'])**: Player 1 is not a werewolf!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: The sun rose. Everyone woke up except those who had been killed.  
**Moderator (-> all)**: It was a peaceful night and no one died!  
**Moderator (-> all)**: Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 1, you please.
