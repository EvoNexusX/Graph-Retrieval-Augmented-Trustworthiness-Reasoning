Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 1 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.913
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 4'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 8'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Final**: (3-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 8.
