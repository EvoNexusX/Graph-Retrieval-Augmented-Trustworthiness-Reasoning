Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.5.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 4'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 2'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
