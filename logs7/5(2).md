- **Final**: (1-th daytime) ### Step-by-Step Thought Process:  1. **Observation of the Votes**:     - Player 7, Player 8, Player 4, Player 2, and Player 5 have all voted to kill Player 1.     - Player 1 has voted to kill Player 8.  2. **Analysis of Patterns**:     - There is a strong consensus among the players to eliminate Player 1.     - Player 1 is under heavy suspicion, possibly because they might be a werewolf, or the wolves might be orchestrating their elimination to create confusion.  3. **Strategic Consideration**:     - As the guard, I must balance between maintaining my hidden role and making strategic votes.     - Voting with the majority can help me blend in and avoid suspicion.  4. **Reflection on Role and Objective**:     - My goal is to protect villagers and identify werewolves.      - If Player 1 is indeed a werewolf, voting to eliminate them aligns with my objective.     - If Player 1 is not a werewolf, the heavy consensus to eliminate them might be a tactic by werewolves to mislead us.  5. **Conclusion**:     - Given the overwhelming votes against Player 1 and the need to avoid drawing attention to myself, it is safer to vote with the majority at this stage.     - This vote will also give more information based on the outcome, which can be analyzed in subsequent rounds.  ### My Concise Talking Content: I choose to vote to eliminate Player 1.

Player 5 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 3', 'Player 4'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 8', 'Player 5', 'Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
