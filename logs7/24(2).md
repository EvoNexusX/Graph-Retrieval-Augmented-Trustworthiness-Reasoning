- **Final**: (2-th night) **My step-by-step thought process:**  1. **Review Player Roles and Actions:**    - **Player 4**: Identified as the seer and correctly pointed out Player 7 as a werewolf, who was subsequently eliminated. Player 4 seems to be reliable.    - **Player 3**: Appears to be the guard based on their protective behavior. They should be a valuable ally but cannot protect the same person consecutively.    - **Player 7**: Was identified as a werewolf by Player 4, so they were a target.    - **Current Situation**: I have not used my poison yet and should choose to eliminate a potential werewolf to aid in winning the game.  2. **Consider the Remaining Players:**    - **Player 2, Player 5, Player 6, Player 8**: Their roles and intentions are unknown to me. I need to consider the possibility that one of these could be a werewolf.  3. **Strategy for Night Actions:**    - **Since Player 4 is trustworthy and Player 3 is likely an ally,** the remaining unknown players are potential werewolves.    - **Based on the prior night’s events and the elimination of Player 7,** we should look for suspicious behavior or patterns.  4. **Decide on the Target for Poison:**    - **I should target a player who is most likely to be a werewolf based on the current information and previous votes.** Without specific evidence from previous discussions or the current night’s context, I would target a player who seems to be an enemy or poses a high risk.  **My concise talking content:** I choose to poison Player 2.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 1'])**: Failed, your poison has run out!  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 4'])**: You seer, Player 4, please open your eyes! Who are you going to verify its identity tonight? Choose only one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, Player 5, Player 6, Player 8, pass].
