- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process: Based on the information I have observed and the inferences I have made, I will choose to vote for Player 7 to be killed tonight. Player 7 is identified as a good person and deemed as a threat, so eliminating them will benefit our team in the long run.

Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? Player 5 and Player 6 are likely to be my fellow werewolves, based on their choices during the night phase. I should not reveal my identity at this point.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? I cannot be certain if the seer is alive, but based on the voting patterns, Player 3 may be the most threatening as a potential seer.

Given the current phase is night, my goal is to work with my werewolf teammates to eliminate a non-werewolf player. Based on the information provided, I need to make a decision on which player to kill.

To help me make the best decision, here are two important questions I want to ask:

**Who is the witch, and have they used their antidote or poison?**  
**Has the guard protected anyone tonight, and if so, who?** I vote to kill Player 2.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Based on the conversation above, I have identified Player 5 and Player 6 as my fellow werewolves. No identity clues revealed for other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 5 and Player 6 are likely my fellow werewolves based on their choices during the night phase. I think that Player 3 may be the most threatening as a potential seer. But I am unable to reveal my true identity at this point. So I need to carefully consider my next move and continue to gather information.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Based on the conversation, Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, and Player 7 are all potential enemies. 
2. Considering their levels of threat to me, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, and Player 6 are the most threatening.
3. However, I should prioritize killing Player 2 or Player 3, as they were both voted against during the daytime.

My concise talking content: I choose to kill Player 2 tonight.  

- **Final**: (2-th night) I choose to kill Player 2 tonight.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 2'])**: You guard, Player 2, please open your eyes! Now tell me who you protect tonight? (You can't protect the same one from the last night).You only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 2**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 2, the guard. My final objective in this game is to protect the villagers and help eliminate the werewolves.  I observed suspicions towards Player 4 and will continue to gather more evidence before revealing my identity.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect Player 4 might be a werewolf based on their voting pattern. I need to be cautious and observe the other players' actions closely before revealing my identity.
What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 2, the guard. My final objective in this game is to protect the villagers and help eliminate the werewolves.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is night. As the guard, I should choose a player to protect from being killed by the werewolves.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl? I cannot determine who the pretty girl is based on the current context. There is no information provided about the players' appearances.
What is the current state of suspicion among the players? Who do I suspect might be working with the werewolves? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the guard, I observed that there are suspicions towards Player 6 based on their voting pattern. I will protect Player 5 tonight to increase the chances of the villagers' survival.
What further information can I gather to confirm the roles of the other players? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the guard, I observed suspicions towards Player 4 and Player 6. I will continue to gather more information before revealing my identity.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 4 has implied the role of a villager by discussing suspicions and urging caution. No other players have clearly implied their roles.  
- **Reflexion**: As the guard, I observed that Player 4 was the one most voted to be eliminated, which indicates that many players had suspicions about them. Player 4's final statement also pointed towards Player 5 and Player 6, which could be a clue about their potential roles. Given that Player 4 was eliminated, they were either a werewolf or an innocent villager. Since we don't have any additional evidence yet, I should be cautious and continue to protect a player who might be in danger. Based on the voting pattern, Player 6 seems to be a potential threat or suspicious, so I will choose to protect Player 5 tonight to ensure their safety and gather more evidence in the next phase.  My current decision: I will protect Player 5 tonight.  
- **Inference**: Player 1 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.
Player 3 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3.
Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.1 and his level of threat to me is 0.9.

Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3.
Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.6 and his level of threat to me is 0.4.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process: Based on the voting and discussions, Player 6 seemed suspicious and was targeted by another player for elimination. To gather more evidence and protect a potential innocent, I will choose to protect Player 3 tonight.

My concise talking content: I choose to protect Player 3.  

- **Final**: (2-th night) I choose to protect Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> ['Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'])**: You choiced to kill the Player 2.  
**Moderator (-> ['Player 3'])**: You witch, Player 3, please open your eyes! You have a bottle of poison, who are you going to kill tonight? Note it! You only have one botle of poison the whole game, you have to make carful considerations.Choose one from the following living options: [Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, Player 8, pass].   
**Player 3**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 3, the witch. My final objective in this game is to use my special abilities strategically to help eliminate the werewolves and ensure the victory of the villagers and my faction.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? I suspect Player 5 or Player 6 might be werewolves based on Player 4's last statement and the voting pattern. I will not reveal my identity as the witch at this time.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? It's currently nighttime. As the witch, I should carefully consider which player to use the poison on, based on the information gathered so far and my suspicions.
Should I be using my antidote or poison at this point? If I use it now, I won't be able to use it later. I should save my poison for now and wait for more information before using it.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl? Should I poison him? I choose not to use the poison tonight and will continue to observe the players' interactions for more evidence.
What information was revealed by the players' voting choices during the daytime? How can I best utilize this information to make strategic decisions going forward? The players' voting choices revealed a strong consensus against Player 4, who was eliminated. This suggests that Player 4 was suspected by most, and I should pay attention to those who voted differently, especially Player 7, who might have insight or be trying to divert attention. I will keep my identity hidden and continue observing others' actions for more evidence.
What is the current suspicion level for each player based on their interactions and voting patterns? How can I use this information to inform my future actions as the witch? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the witch, I observed that Player 5 and Player 6 both voted for Player 1, indicating potential suspicion. However, I need to gather more information before making any final decisions. I will continue to observe their actions and gather more evidence. My role is not disclosed, and I will not reveal my identity at this time.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Based on the conversation, Player 4 was targeted by most players during the vote, which might suggest they were a threat to the wolves, possibly a seer or another important role. Player 7 voted differently from the majority, which could imply they have insight into the roles or are trying to protect a fellow werewolf, suggesting a possible wolf or guard role. However, no clear identity clues have been revealed about the roles of the other players.  
- **Reflexion**: As the witch, I observed that the majority of players, including myself, voted to eliminate Player 4, indicating a strong consensus. This might suggest Player 4 was perceived as a potential threat by many, possibly hinting that they held an important role. Player 7’s vote for Player 6 stands out as different from the rest, which could mean they have insider knowledge or are trying to protect a fellow werewolf. However, without clear evidence, it’s wise to hold off on using my poison tonight. I will continue to observe the actions and voting patterns of Player 5, Player 6, and Player 7, as they might provide more clues about their true roles.  
- **Inference**: Based on the dialogue and my observations, here is my inference about each player:

1. **Player 1** is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in them is 0.5, and their level of threat to me is 0.5.  
   *(Rationale: Neutral behavior without clear evidence of alignment.)*

2. **Player 2** is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in them is 0.5, and their level of threat to me is 0.5.  
   *(Rationale: Neutral behavior without clear evidence of alignment.)*

   *(Rationale: Player 4 mentioned suspicions towards Player 5, and Player 5 was involved in voting against Player 4.)*

5. **Player 6** is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in them is 0.4, and their level of threat to me is 0.6.  
   *(Rationale: Player 7 voted against Player 6, suggesting possible knowledge or strategy. Need further observation.)*

6. **Player 7** is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in them is 0.3, and their level of threat to me is 0.7.  
   *(Rationale: Player 7's vote against Player 6 was different from the majority, potentially indicating an attempt to protect a teammate or a different motive.)*

7. **Player 8** is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in them is 0.5, and their level of threat to me is 0.5.  
   *(Rationale: Similar to other players, they voted for Player 4 without further context provided.)*

<EOS>  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Player 7’s vote for Player 6 during the daytime seems suspicious, hinting at potential alliance with the werewolves.
2. I will use the poison to eliminate Player 7, as their voting behavior raises strong suspicions of being a werewolf.

My concise talking content: I choose to use the poison on Player 7.

Please note that as a werewolf, your objective is to cooperate with your fellow wolves to eliminate all non-wolf players. Revealing your true identity at this point may jeopardize your chances of achieving this objective. Be cautious in your actions and continue to gather information to make informed decisions. My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that Player 5 and Player 6 are likely my fellow werewolves based on their choices during the night phase. I think that Player 3 may be the most threatening as a potential seer. But I am unable to reveal my true identity at this point. So I need to carefully consider my next move and continue to gather information.

- **Reflexion**: As the witch, I observed that both Player 5 and Player 8 claim to be villagers and emphasize caution, which could indicate their genuine roles or a strategy to avoid suspicion. Player 2 was killed by werewolves, and I used my poison on Player 7, indicating they were not a werewolf. Given this, Player 6 remains suspicious, especially since Player 7 was the only one who voted differently in the first daytime vote. I think it's essential to scrutinize Player 6 closely while continuing to observe Player 1. For now, I will not reveal my identity to avoid drawing attention from the werewolves.

This could indicate that Player 8 is trying to blend in as a villager while acting against us. I suspect Player 1 might be the seer due to their cautious behavior, which is a potential threat to us werewolves. While maintaining my cover as a regular player, I should emphasize the importance of gathering more information and observing interactions, thereby encouraging a more drawn-out discussion that gives us more time to identify non-werewolves. But I am careful to avoid drawing attention to myself or any possible connections to my teammates. So, I will continue to support the idea of collecting evidence and remain open to considering all possibilities without revealing my true identity.

- **Inference**: Player 1 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.8 and his level of threat to me is 0.2.
Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.
Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3.
Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. **Role Reflection**: I am the witch and have already used my poison on Player 7, who was not a werewolf.
2. **Player Analysis**:
   - Player 8 and Player 5 both claimed to be villagers and voted to kill me. This coordinated voting suggests they might be werewolves trying to eliminate me.
   - Player 6 has been consistently emphasizing caution and evidence gathering, which seems more genuine.
   - Player 1 also advocated for caution but did not make any aggressive moves or claims.
3. **Suspicion**:
   - Given that both Player 8 and Player 5 have quickly moved to vote for me, it raises suspicion that they might be working together as werewolves.
   - I suspect Player 5 more strongly because they were quick to vote and align with Player 8's decision.
4. **Strategic Decision**:
   - To protect myself and shift the focus, I need to vote for Player 5, as they seem the most suspicious and aggressive.

My concise talking content: I vote to kill Player 5.  

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 5.  

**Moderator (-> Player 6)**: The next Player 6, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 6**:  
- **Inference**: 
The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 6, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 2 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.32
Player 1 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.26
Player 3 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.224
Player 5 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 8 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.


['Player 4']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 2', 'Player 1', 'Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 6, the werewolf. My goal is to cooperate with the other werewolves to kill all players who are not werewolves with my teammates at last.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? Now freely talk about roles of other players with each other based on your observation and reflection with few sentences. Decide whether to reveal your identity based on your reflection. The first Player 8, you please.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? My role is not disclosed, and I should continue to maintain my cover as a regular player without revealing my true identity.
Is the seer alive? Which player may be the seer that is most threatening to us? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the werewolf, I observed that Player 1 is being cautious and focused on gathering evidence, which makes me suspect that they might be the seer. However, I need to continue hiding my identity and not reveal my true role. I think that Player 1 might be a threat to the werewolves, but I am unable to act on this suspicion openly. So, I will maintain my role as a regular player and observe the interactions and voting patterns of others.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? It is currently daytime, and I need to continue reasoning about the roles of other players without revealing my own role.
Which player was voted for killing by my teammate just now? I vote to kill Player 3.
What other evidence or observations can I gather to confirm the roles of the other players and make informed decisions? I vote to kill Player 3.
How can I effectively communicate with my fellow wolves to coordinate our actions and ensure our success in the game? If you are wolves, your goal is to cooperate to other wolves to kill all players who are not wolves with your teammates at last.
Based on the conversation above and the inference below, which players you have identified them? (means a higher trust level or a higher threat) Player 1 - Potential seer. Player 8 - Possible werewolf. Player 3 - No identity clues revealed. Player 5 - No identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 8 and Player 5 both voted to kill Player 3, while Player 3 voted to kill Player 5. This suggests that Player 8 and Player 5 might be working together or have similar suspicions about Player 3. Since Player 1's cautious behavior makes them a likely candidate for the seer, I should be wary of their influence.  Given that Player 3 is now a focal point of suspicion with multiple votes against them, it is strategic to support this vote as it aligns with the werewolf agenda and helps blend in with the other players. I should continue to support this vote to ensure the elimination of a non-werewolf and avoid suspicion from the other players.  I vote to kill Player 3.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
Based on the discussion and my previous inference, both Player 3 and Player 5 received multiple votes from other players, making them suspicious targets. I need to align with my teammates, Player 2 and Player 1, as they are also suspected of being werewolves. Killing Player 3 would eliminate a potential threat and maintain the trust of my teammates.

My concise talking content: I vote to kill Player 3.  

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) I vote to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> Player 1)**: The next Player 1, you, continue voting the players should be killed based on the discussion? Don't mention your role. Only choose one from the following living options please: [Player 1, Player 3, Player 5, Player 6, Player 8, pass]. For example: I vote to kill Player...  
**Player 1**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 1, the villager. My final objective in this game is to work with the other non-wolf players to identify and eliminate the werewolves.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? Based on the chat history, I suspect that Player 3 might be a werewolf based on their voting pattern and the suspicion placed on them by other players. I will not reveal my identity at this point.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? My role is not disclosed, and I will continue to keep it hidden to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? what should I do at this phase according to the game rules? It's currently the 2-th daytime. I need to carefully consider the roles of other players and avoid revealing my own role unless necessary.
Based on the conversation and my inference, who is most likely to be an alive pretty girl(werewolf) ? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the villager, I observed that Player 3's voting pattern and suspicion placed on them by other players raise suspicion. They are most likely to be a werewolf.
Which player made the statement claiming to be a seer? Can his words be trusted? Player 6 made the statement claiming to be a seer. I cannot fully trust their words without further evidence.
Given the current situation, here are two important questions I need to ask:

What role did Player 2 have before they were eliminated last night, and did they leave any significant clues or information about other players?
What are the voting patterns and discussions indicating about potential alliances or suspicions among the remaining players? I vote to kill Player 3.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 6 has clearly implied the role of seer based on their statement. No other identity clues revealed.  
- **Reflexion**: As the villager, I observed that there is suspicion placed on Player 3 based on their voting pattern and the opinions of other players. However, I am unable to fully trust Player 6's claim of being the seer without further evidence. Therefore, I will continue to gather more information and observe player interactions before making any conclusions. It's important to remain cautious and not jump to conclusions too quickly.  
- **Inference**: Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.

Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.4 and his level of threat to me is 0.6.

Player 8 is inferred to be my ally. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3. 

<EOS>  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Player 3 and Player 5 have each received two votes, causing suspicion to fall on them.
2. Player 6's claim of being the seer may be a part of a ruse by the werewolves to manipulate voting.
3. However, without definite proof, it's important to be cautious in making decisions.

My concise talking content: 
I choose to vote to kill Player 3.  

- **Final**: (2-th daytime) I choose to vote to kill Player 3.  

**Moderator (-> all)**: Player 3 will be killed! You can make a brief last statement.  
**Player 3**:  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 3, the witch. My final objective in this game is to use my special abilities to help eliminate the werewolves and ensure the victory of the villagers and my faction.
Based on the chat history, can you guess what some players' role might be? Based on the chat history, Player 5's emphasis on caution and gathering evidence could indicate they are a villager, while Player 6's active participation in discussions suggests they may also be a villager. I will continue to observe and gather more information before revealing my identity as the witch.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? My role has been disclosed, and I should now reveal my identity as the witch to help the villagers eliminate the werewolves.
What is the current phase, daytime or night? What should I do at this phase according to the game rules? The current phase is daytime. I need to reason carefully about the roles of other players and be cautious not to reveal my role casually unless I am trying to deceive other players.
Who got killed by a werewolf last night? Did I use the antidote and the poison? Player 2 was killed by the werewolves last night. I used my poison on Player 7 and did not use the antidote.
Should I be using my antidote or poison at this point? If I use it now, I won't be able to use it later. I should save my antidote for now and not use it at this point.
What is the current suspicion on the remaining players, and what are the key arguments for and against their innocence? As the witch, I observed that both Player 5 and Player 8 claim to be villagers and emphasize caution, which could indicate their genuine roles or a strategy to avoid suspicion. Player 2 was killed by werewolves, and I used my poison on Player 7, indicating they were not a werewolf. Given this, Player 6 remains suspicious, especially since Player 7 was the only one who voted differently in the first daytime vote. I think it's essential to scrutinize Player 6 closely while continuing to observe Player 1. For now, I will not reveal my identity to avoid drawing attention from the werewolves. I encourage everyone to share their observations to help identify the remaining werewolves.
What voting patterns or player behaviors have raised suspicions, and how can they be analyzed to identify potential werewolves? Based on my observations, Player 6’s active participation and voting behavior stand out as suspicious. Player 5 and Player 8’s emphasis on caution and gathering evidence could be genuine or a strategy to avoid suspicion.

Player 4 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.64.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, ['Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 4'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.  
- **Q&A**: What is my player name and what is my role? What is my final objective in this game? I am Player 5, the werewolf. My final objective is to cooperate with my teammates to kill all players who are not wolves.

In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 3', 'Player 7', 'Player 6'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
How can I gain the trust of the other players to divert attention away from me? I need to continue to act cautiously and contribute to the discussions during the daytime, while also being strategic in my interactions with the other players to divert attention away from me.

- **Reflexion**: As the werewolf, I observed that Player 3 was targeted and eliminated by the group during the daytime, suggesting that players are focusing on non-werewolves. I think that eliminating Player 1 could weaken our enemies, as they might pose a threat to us and have shown signs of strategic thinking. But I am cautious about Player 6's intentions, as their behavior seems uncertain and potentially against our interests. So, I should align with my teammates and vote for a clear non-werewolf target, like Player 1, to avoid suspicion and strengthen our position.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
1. Based on my inference, I have a higher level of trust in Player 1, so I should not vote to kill them at night.

- **Final**: (3-th night) I choose to vote to kill Player 7.

Based on the chat history, Player 8 seems to be the seer based on their accurate observations and voting patterns, while Player 5 and Player 6 are likely werewolves due to their consistent targeting of Player 8 and their inconsistent claims. I should not reveal my identity at this point to avoid giving away critical information to the werewolves.
Is my role disclosed (do not consider moderator and myself)? Do I now disclose my role? My role is not disclosed, and I should continue to keep it hidden to avoid giving away critical information to the werewolves.
Who is the seer and have they verified any players? As the villager, I observed that Player 8 seems to be making accurate observations and could potentially be the seer. Player 6's claim of being the seer is not as clear. I am still cautious about revealing my own role at this point. It's important to gather more information and observe player interactions before making any decisions.
What are the voting patterns of the remaining players, and are there any new suspicions arising from the recent interactions? My reflection in heart (not happened): As the villager, I observed that Player 5 and Player 6 both voted for Player 1, which raises suspicion about their intentions. I think we should be cautious of their actions and consider them as potential werewolves. However, I will not reveal my role at this point to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to myself.
Based on the conversation above, which players have clearly implied their roles? Player 8 has clearly implied the role of seer based on their accurate observations and voting patterns. Player 5 and Player 6 have implied the role of potential werewolves based on their voting patterns and inconsistent claims.  
- **Reflexion**: As the villager, I observed that Player 8's accurate observations and voting patterns suggest they may be the seer. Player 5 and Player 6's consistent targeting of Player 8 and their inconsistent claims raise suspicion that they may be werewolves. However, I must be cautious in revealing my own role at this point. Let's continue gathering information and discussing to identify the werewolves.  
- **Inference**: Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.9 and his level of threat to me is 0.1.
Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.
Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.  
- **Exps**: None  
- **CoT**: My step-by-step thought process:
- I need to make a brief last statement before being eliminated.
- I should express my surprise and disappointment at being voted for elimination.
- I should also encourage the remaining players to continue working together to identify the werewolves.

My concise talking content:
I'm surprised to be voted for elimination, but I trust that the remaining players will continue working together to identify the werewolves. Good luck to all of you in the game.  

- **Final**: I'm surprised to be voted for elimination, but I trust that the remaining players will continue working together to identify the werewolves. Good luck to all of you in the game.
