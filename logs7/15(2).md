The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 1, the villager. I trust myself very much.
Player 2 is inferred to be a werewolf, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.

['Player 8']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 3'] are more trustworthy to me. [] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
