The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 2, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.951 and his level of threat to me is 0.049.

Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.05 and his level of threat to me is 0.95.

Player 4 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.588 and his level of threat to me is 0.412.

Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.56 and his level of threat to me is 0.44.

Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.946 and his level of threat to me is 0.054.

Player 7 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.05 and his level of threat to me is 0.95.

Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.601 and his level of threat to me is 0.399.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 1', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 3', 'Player 7'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
