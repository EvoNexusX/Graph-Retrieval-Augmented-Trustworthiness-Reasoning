The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.183.
['Player 4', 'Player 1', 'Player 2', 'Player 3', 'Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 7']'s identities are still unsure.The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, [] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 8'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
