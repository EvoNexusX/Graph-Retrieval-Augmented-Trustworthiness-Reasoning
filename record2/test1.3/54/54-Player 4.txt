The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 4, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 2 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.578 and his level of threat to me is 0.422.

Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.42 and his level of threat to me is 0.58.

Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.448 and his level of threat to me is 0.552.

Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.415 and his level of threat to me is 0.585.

Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.578 and his level of threat to me is 0.422.

Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.37 and his level of threat to me is 0.63.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 2', 'Player 7'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 3', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
