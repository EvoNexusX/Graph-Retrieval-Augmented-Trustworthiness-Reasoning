The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 1, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 5 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 7 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
Player 8 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.9.
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.762.


['Player 4']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 5'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 7', 'Player 8', 'Player 3'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
