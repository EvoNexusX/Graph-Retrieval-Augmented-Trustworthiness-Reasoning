The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 2, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 7 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 1 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.964
Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.964
Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.74.
Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.618.
Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.3.The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 1'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 4', 'Player 5', 'Player 3'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
