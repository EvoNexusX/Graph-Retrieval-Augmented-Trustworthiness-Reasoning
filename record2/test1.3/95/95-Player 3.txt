The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 2.844
Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.148
Player 2 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.087
Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.046.
Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.834.
Player 1 is inferred to be my enemy. His level of threat to me is 0.104.The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 7', 'Player 5', 'Player 2'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 8', 'Player 4', 'Player 1'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
