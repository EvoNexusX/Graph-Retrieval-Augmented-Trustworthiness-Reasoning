Player 3 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.3 and his level of threat to me is 0.7.

Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.7 and his level of threat to me is 0.3.

Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.6 and his level of threat to me is 0.4. 

Player 3 has been aggressively targeting Players 6 and 7, which aligns with the behavior of a werewolf trying to shift suspicion. Therefore, focusing on Player 3 for elimination is a sound strategy for the villagers.
