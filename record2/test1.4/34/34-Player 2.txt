The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 2, the witch. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0


['Player 3', 'Player 4', 'Player 5', 'Player 6', 'Player 7', 'Player 8']'s identities are still unsure, I cannot say any information about them.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 1'] are more trustworthy to me. [] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
