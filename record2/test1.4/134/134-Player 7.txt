The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 7, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 2 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 3 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 4 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 5 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
Player 6 is inferred to be a good people, my enemy. His level of threat to me is 1.0.
Player 8 is inferred to be a werewolf, my teammate. My level of trust in him is 1.0
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.

In these players, None are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 6'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
