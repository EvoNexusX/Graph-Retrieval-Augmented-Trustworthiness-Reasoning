The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the guard. I trust myself very much.
Player 1's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 2's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 4's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 5's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 6's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 7's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5 and his level of threat to me is 0.5.

Player 8 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.608 and his level of threat to me is 0.392.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 8'] are more trustworthy to me. [] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
