The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the guard. I trust myself very much.
Player 1's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.5120000000000001 and his level of threat to me is 0.488.

Player 2 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.408 and his level of threat to me is 0.592.

Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.437 and his level of threat to me is 0.563.

Player 5 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.279 and his level of threat to me is 0.721.

Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.423 and his level of threat to me is 0.577.

Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.6245999999999999 and his level of threat to me is 0.375.

Player 8's identity seems to be neutral. My level of trust in him is 0.522 and his level of threat to me is 0.478.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 7'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 6', 'Player 2', 'Player 5'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
