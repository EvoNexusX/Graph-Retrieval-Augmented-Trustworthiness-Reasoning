The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 3, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 2 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.592 and his level of threat to me is 0.408.

Player 4 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.675 and his level of threat to me is 0.325.

Player 6 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 7 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.58 and his level of threat to me is 0.42.

Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 5', 'Player 2', 'Player 7'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 4', 'Player 6', 'Player 8'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
