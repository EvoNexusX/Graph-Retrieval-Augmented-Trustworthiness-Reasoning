The below are my inference of the other players:
I am Player 4, the werewolf. I trust myself very much.
Player 1 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 2 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.565 and his level of threat to me is 0.435.

Player 3 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.663 and his level of threat to me is 0.337.

Player 5 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.702 and his level of threat to me is 0.298.

Player 6 is inferred to be my teammate. My level of trust in him is 0.561 and his level of threat to me is 0.439.

Player 7 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.

Player 8 is inferred to be my enemy. My level of trust in him is 0.2 and his level of threat to me is 0.8.
The greater the level of trust, the more I should protect him, and the greater the level of threat, the more I should eliminate him.
In these players, ['Player 5', 'Player 3', 'Player 2'] are more trustworthy to me. ['Player 1', 'Player 7', 'Player 8'] are more threatening to me, and I need to be very aware of them.
