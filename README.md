# Graph Retrieval Augmented Trustworthiness Reasoning

This paper has presented a novel framework called Graph Retrieval Augmented Trustworthiness Reasoning (GRATR). GRATR employs a dynamic trustworthiness relationship graph, updated in real-time with new evidence, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of trustworthiness assessments among players. The framework consists of two main phases:  During the player observation phase, evidence is collected to update the nodes and edges of the graph in real-time. During the player's turn, the relevant evidence chain and the trustworthiness of the player's action object are retrieved to improve reasoning and decision-making. The effectiveness of GRATR is demonstrated through experiments in the multiplayer game ‘Werewolf’, where it outperforms existing methods in key metrics such as game winning rate, overall performance, and reasoning ability. It also effectively solves the illusion of large language models, and enables the traceability and visualization of the reasoning process through time evidence and evidence chains.
